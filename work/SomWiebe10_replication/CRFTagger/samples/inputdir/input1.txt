OAKLAND, Calif., Dec. 3 — A replica of what looks like Han Solo of “Star Wars, ” frozen in carbonite, sits outside Jim Lanzone’s office her. 
A closer inspection , however , reveals that the frozen body is that of another fictional character : Jeeves , the English butler best known in Internet circles as the mascot of the Ask Jeeves search engine . 
For Mr. Lanzone , chief executive of Ask.com , the prop is a reminder of what the Internet search company he runs has ceased to be . 
Ask Jeeves was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp , headed by Barry Diller , in March 2005 for nearly $ 2 billion . 
A year later , IAC ditched Jeeves and renamed the search service Ask.com . 
“The reputation of Ask Jeeves was very poor , ” Mr. Lanzone said . 
Now , Mr. Lanzone , who became chief executive in April , is ready to proclaim that efforts to transform that reputation are paying off . 
Like every other major search company , Ask would like to narrow Google’s huge lead in search and search advertising . 
After losing a distribution deal with Dell Computer late last year , Ask actually gave up market share to other search engines . 
But Mr. Lanzone said that in the last four months , Ask has steadily regained ground , to grab the No. 4 spot — even as larger companies like Microsoft and AOL , whose search is run by Google , have seen their market share erode . 
On Monday , Ask.com is introducing AskCity , a service that integrates maps with information about local businesses , restaurants , concert and movie listings and reviews . 
These so-called local searches already account for 10 percent of all Internet queries and are expected to grow faster than other searches . 
They are also seen as a way to tap into tens of billions in spending by small businesses , which have yet to switch much of their advertising dollars to the Internet . 
Early reviews of the service by analysts are positive , and Mr. Lanzone said AskCity , which makes use of data from other IAC businesses like Citysearch and Ticketmaster , was just the kind of service that was slowly helping Ask build a top-quality search engine . 
“Right now , the focus is almost entirely on improving the user experience , ” Mr. Lanzone said . 
“This is the product that , to date , we are the most proud of . 
It is going to have a huge impact for people who use Ask.”
