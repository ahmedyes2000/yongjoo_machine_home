After the collapse of the dot-com bubble , shares of Ask Jeeves dropped below $ 1 and the company was close to extinction . 
But in 2001 , it sowed the seeds of its rebirth when it spent about $ 4 million to acquire Teoma Technologies , a small company in New Jersey that had developed well-regarded search technology . 
A year later , Ask Jeeves got a lifeline from Google , which cut a deal to place ads next to Ask Jeeves search results . 
Other major search engines largely organize results based on the number of links a Web site receives from other sites . 
But Teoma’s software first clusters sites based on content categories , then chooses the most popular sites in those categories . 
That approach , known as Expert Rank , has allowed Ask to do a better job at finding specialty sites that may be the most authoritative on a given subject , even though they may not be the most popular . 
Ask also has differentiated itself by giving users previews of the Web sites that appear in their searches and offering simple ways to narrow or expand search results . 
In a search for the keywords “California and wine , ” for instance , a set of options will appear next to the results allowing you to focus your search on , say , California wineries , California wine ratings or California wine prices . 
You can also expand your query to famous foods in California . 
And Ask eliminated the emphasis on answering questions through Ask Jeeves , a feat it was able to accomplish on only a limited number of queries . 
The steady improvements have earned Ask the praise of analysts , reviewers and even some competitors . 
“They are doing a lot of clever and interesting things , ” said Marissa Mayer , Google’s vice president for search products and user experience . 
AskCity is getting similar praise .
