It is going to have a huge impact for people who use Ask.” 
For his part , Mr. Diller said AskCity was a demonstration of Ask’s role in helping tie together the disparate properties owned by IAC . 
AskCity is “a really good service that is dependent on the information from all these IAC sites , which is the raison d’être of the company itself , ” Mr. Diller said , adding that over time , other IAC entities , which include HSN , LendingTree.com , 
Evite and Match.com , will be more tightly integrated with Ask . 
Accounting for 5.8 percent of all the searches in the United States in October , Ask has edged out AOL to become the fourth most popular search engine , according to comScore Media Metrix . 
By comparison , Google had 45.4 percent of all searches , Yahoo 28.2 percent and Microsoft 11.7 percent . 
Data from Nielsen NetRatings , which measures only searches on Ask.com , 
not on related sites in the Ask network , shows that Ask’s use grew 25 percent in October from a year earlier , the second highest rate of growth among the major search engines , after Yahoo . 
The turnaround of Ask began long before Mr. Diller acquired the company .
