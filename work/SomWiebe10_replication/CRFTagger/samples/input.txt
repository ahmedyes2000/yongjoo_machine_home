OAKLAND , Calif. , Dec. 3 — A replica of what looks like Han Solo of “Star Wars , ” frozen in carbonite , sits outside Jim Lanzone’s office here . 
A closer inspection , however , reveals that the frozen body is that of another fictional character : Jeeves , the English butler best known in Internet circles as the mascot of the Ask Jeeves search engine . 
For Mr. Lanzone , chief executive of Ask.com , the prop is a reminder of what the Internet search company he runs has ceased to be . 
Ask Jeeves was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp , headed by Barry Diller , in March 2005 for nearly $ 2 billion . 
A year later , IAC ditched Jeeves and renamed the search service Ask.com . 
“The reputation of Ask Jeeves was very poor , ” Mr. Lanzone said . 
Now , Mr. Lanzone , who became chief executive in April , is ready to proclaim that efforts to transform that reputation are paying off . 
Like every other major search company , Ask would like to narrow Google’s huge lead in search and search advertising . 
After losing a distribution deal with Dell Computer late last year , Ask actually gave up market share to other search engines . 
But Mr. Lanzone said that in the last four months , Ask has steadily regained ground , to grab the No. 4 spot — even as larger companies like Microsoft and AOL , whose search is run by Google , have seen their market share erode . 
On Monday , Ask.com is introducing AskCity , a service that integrates maps with information about local businesses , restaurants , concert and movie listings and reviews . 
These so-called local searches already account for 10 percent of all Internet queries and are expected to grow faster than other searches . 
They are also seen as a way to tap into tens of billions in spending by small businesses , which have yet to switch much of their advertising dollars to the Internet . 
Early reviews of the service by analysts are positive , and Mr. Lanzone said AskCity , which makes use of data from other IAC businesses like Citysearch and Ticketmaster , was just the kind of service that was slowly helping Ask build a top-quality search engine . 
“Right now , the focus is almost entirely on improving the user experience , ” Mr. Lanzone said . 
“This is the product that , to date , we are the most proud of . 
It is going to have a huge impact for people who use Ask.” 
For his part , Mr. Diller said AskCity was a demonstration of Ask’s role in helping tie together the disparate properties owned by IAC . 
AskCity is “a really good service that is dependent on the information from all these IAC sites , which is the raison d’être of the company itself , ” Mr. Diller said , adding that over time , other IAC entities , which include HSN , LendingTree.com , 
Evite and Match.com , will be more tightly integrated with Ask . 
Accounting for 5.8 percent of all the searches in the United States in October , Ask has edged out AOL to become the fourth most popular search engine , according to comScore Media Metrix . 
By comparison , Google had 45.4 percent of all searches , Yahoo 28.2 percent and Microsoft 11.7 percent . 
Data from Nielsen NetRatings , which measures only searches on Ask.com , 
not on related sites in the Ask network , shows that Ask’s use grew 25 percent in October from a year earlier , the second highest rate of growth among the major search engines , after Yahoo . 
The turnaround of Ask began long before Mr. Diller acquired the company . 
After the collapse of the dot-com bubble , shares of Ask Jeeves dropped below $ 1 and the company was close to extinction . 
But in 2001 , it sowed the seeds of its rebirth when it spent about $ 4 million to acquire Teoma Technologies , a small company in New Jersey that had developed well-regarded search technology . 
A year later , Ask Jeeves got a lifeline from Google , which cut a deal to place ads next to Ask Jeeves search results . 
Other major search engines largely organize results based on the number of links a Web site receives from other sites . 
But Teoma’s software first clusters sites based on content categories , then chooses the most popular sites in those categories . 
That approach , known as Expert Rank , has allowed Ask to do a better job at finding specialty sites that may be the most authoritative on a given subject , even though they may not be the most popular . 
Ask also has differentiated itself by giving users previews of the Web sites that appear in their searches and offering simple ways to narrow or expand search results . 
In a search for the keywords “California and wine , ” for instance , a set of options will appear next to the results allowing you to focus your search on , say , California wineries , California wine ratings or California wine prices . 
You can also expand your query to famous foods in California . 
And Ask eliminated the emphasis on answering questions through Ask Jeeves , a feat it was able to accomplish on only a limited number of queries . 
The steady improvements have earned Ask the praise of analysts , reviewers and even some competitors . 
“They are doing a lot of clever and interesting things , ” said Marissa Mayer , Google’s vice president for search products and user experience . 
AskCity is getting similar praise .
