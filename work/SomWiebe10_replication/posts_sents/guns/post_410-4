The NRA's solution of a) reminding people they should be more responsibleb) asking the government to ensure no mentally disturbed person possesses a gun (but not by any restriction on the 2nd amendment, mind you)c) encourage the use of a background check system which they fought tooth and nail against when it was proposed and when it needs funding is a good summary of why the NRA is so reviled.
