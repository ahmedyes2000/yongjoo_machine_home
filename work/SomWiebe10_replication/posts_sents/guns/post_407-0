Can you please provide a credible study that shows that more people are killed by legal gun owners than are killed by criminals using guns ? And how many instances of innocent bystanders being injured or killed by someone using their gun legally in the defense of their lives or the lives of their loved ones, especially when compared to those same situations where no innocent bystanders were injured or killed?
