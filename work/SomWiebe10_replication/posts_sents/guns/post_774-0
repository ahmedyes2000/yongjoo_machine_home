My Reasons why No Guns on Campus:1) Someone who may have a mental illness may hurt or kill someone.2) There are some(or a lot) of cases that kids in Elementry, Middle and High schools manage to get guns from their parents" or grandparents" room or get a gun from someone else.3) Some colleges tend to have their students to have parties with alchols and if two people(may be drunk) may began to argue a bit and out of norwhere, one of them pull out a gun and shot the another person.
