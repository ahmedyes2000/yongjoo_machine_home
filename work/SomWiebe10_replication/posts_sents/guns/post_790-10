Having a bunch of guns legally on campus would just mean that when a psycho DOES start shooting, EVERYONE will start to shoot EVERYONE ELSE, because they think that THAT person, and THAT person, and THAT person are the shooters since THEY HAVE A GUN!!!Someone is going to take their new gun out to show it to their friends, and they'll get shot, because they're waving a gun around.
