If we banned most guns, I'd be much less worried about a criminal with a gun who wants to kill me. Is the US in a situation where 1.5m to 2.5m times every year, someone has to show a gun to stop a crime, and yet so many crimes still get committed (174 victims per 1,000 citizens age 12 and over in 2006, per the Dept of Justice's summary NCVS ( http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict.htm #summary)?
