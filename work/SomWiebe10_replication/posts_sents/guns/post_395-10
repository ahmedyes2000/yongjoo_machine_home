It is legal in many parts of the country, but not all and fires 1 round per 1 trigger pull (that is semi automatic)the most standard caliber is 223 remington, which has a military counterpart called 5.56x45 they aren't identical but for the sake of this conversation we will assume they are as a 5.56 gun can fire 223 without any issues.it fires a 55gr projectile around 3000 FPS.
