I carry a gun because, when I die (of old age) and go to Heaven, I want to be a Cowboy!I don't carry a gun, because it makes me feel like a man. I carry a gun because real men know how to take care of themselves, and the ones they love,and do so without apology!I don't carry a gun because I'm "inadequate.
