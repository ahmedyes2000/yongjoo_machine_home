Those would be, in a broad sense, the ability to restrict felons and insane persons from owning guns through an instant background check process, and to restrict the use of guns for anything other than their intended purpose (e.g. Self-Defense, target shooting, hunting etc.) Any other restriction, e.g. the type of firearms or restricting the use of guns or the transportation of guns is all unconstitutional.
