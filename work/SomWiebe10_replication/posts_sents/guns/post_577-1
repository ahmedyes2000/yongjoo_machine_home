Personally I feel that everybody should enjoy the freedom to protect themselves, be they felons or even mentally ill people, and the way I feel about it is backed up by the Constitution, as it says we have the freedom to pursue "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" Prohibiting people from owning guns just takes the RKBA from law abiding citizens it does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of those who will use them for evil purposes.
