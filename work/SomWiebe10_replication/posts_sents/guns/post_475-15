1) Pack animals , I had a horse break it's leg and had to put it down (Sad!), 2) stalked once by a mountain lion (very rare) scared it off, 3) blew a lock off a gate at the end of a remote jeep trail (put there by people to impede travel of vehicles for environmental purposes) 5.5 hour journey to return to the trail head, 4) 2 aggressive rattle snakes that I had no way of backing down to avoid, 5) Coyotes trying to attack our 5 month old puppy and drag it out to kill from our campsite.
