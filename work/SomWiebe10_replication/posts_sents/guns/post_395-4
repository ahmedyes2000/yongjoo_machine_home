I guess I couldn't find the 05 data on their site.first look at this its a study by the CDC re: the effectiveness of Gun Laws (Including concealed carry) http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5214a2.htm all their research boils down to "inconsistent results" continuing on with the CDC less than 1% of all homicides and suicides of school age persons (age 10-24) occur in or on school grounds.also according to the CDC between 1992 and 2006, school homicide rate was on the decline, and school related homicides were perpetrated with a firearm 65 or so % of the time.
