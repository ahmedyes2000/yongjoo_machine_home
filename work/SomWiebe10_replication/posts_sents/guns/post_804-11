I would also like to know where you got the stat that average citizens are more likely to "irrationally or accidentally" shoot an innocent person when according to the GOA fact sheet( http://gunowners.org/fs0404.htm )only 2 percent of civilian shootings involve an innocent person being mistaken for a criminal but the error rate for police is more than 11% thats more than 5 times the civilian rate.
