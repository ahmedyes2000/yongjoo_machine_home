Why do students who inherently are istable (puberty) and are fighting (mostly verbally) among each other suited to carry guns in situations where one impulsive reaction of (we have to recall they are still children) a child could easily get another kid killed!Think of the impact for parents and students resulting from one situation where the student making a deadly mistake might not be able to grasp the consequences and will ruin his/her and many others" lives!!
