The permit for concealed carry is actually pretty tough to get, requiring actual classes be completed and passed, criminal background checks, etc. All of that is fine for a concealed carry permit, as opposed to actual ownership, because criminals even though criminals won't bother with the permit, idiots will, and those who would engage in drunken gunfights would be weeded out.
