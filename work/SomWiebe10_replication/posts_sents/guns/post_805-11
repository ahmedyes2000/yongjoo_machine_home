Remember cops are only people too and they also make mistakes statistically they make more mistakes than armed civilians, cwp holders are the most law abiding group of citizens in the country just look up statistics in Florida or Texas(those two states keep the best records) and you will find that around .1 or .2% of all cwp holders are ever arrested for a felony.
