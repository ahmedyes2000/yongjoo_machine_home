Consider also paragraph 1783 of the Catechism which includes:ÒThe education of conscience is indispensable for human beings who are subjected to negative influences and tempted by sin to prefer their own judgment and to reject authoritative teachings.ÓAlthough the Magisterium has a plethora of statements that are definitive authoritative teachings of the Church doctrine regarding the grave sin of abortion, perhaps the most succinct is from Pope John Paul II in Evangelium Vitae who quotes Vatican II documents Lumen Gentium & Gaudium et Spes as well as Pope Paul VI's Humanae Vitae:ÒBy the authority which Christ conferred upon Peter and his successors, in communion with the bishops Ð who on various occasions have condemned abortion and who in the aforementioned consultation, albeit dispersed throughout the world, have shown unanimous agreement concerning this doctrine Ð I declare that direct abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, always constitutes a grave moral disorder, since it is the deliberate killing of an innocent human being.
