This is the main problem and one everybody should agree with: abortion is not good for women, nor for society . We should fight the basic problem that is unwanted pregnancy . And i am sorry but the pope is right: Condoms only policy does not work: we need a better sexual education . I really believe in the ABC system used in Africa: Abstinence, Be Faithful, Condoms:Abstinence until you find a partner, better sexual practices and use of birth control methods.
