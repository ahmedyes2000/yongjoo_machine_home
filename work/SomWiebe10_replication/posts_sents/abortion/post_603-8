That said, if a mother is planning to terminate her pregnancy for reasons other than life or health, I believe this definitely should be done prior to viability outside the uterus AND should be done absolutely as early in the pregnancy as she is aware that she is pregnant, preferably within the first couple of weeks past her missed period.
