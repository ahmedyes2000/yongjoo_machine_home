Children born to mothers without the means to take care of them are more likely to be abused, uneducated, unhealthy, do drugs, commit crimes, etc. In the book Freaknomics, the authors discuss the fact that crime rates inexplicably plummeted about two decades after Roe vs. Wade; they argue that this is because many poor women chose to abort their children rather than have them, resulting in fewer criminals 20 years on.
