the only cost to the woman should be that comparable of an abortion until the 7th month of pregnancy . at which point the woman is being a complete douche-bag and should have to pay for the full cost of HER treatment... but NEVER for the cost of the fetus (which is now a full-fledged baby), since she does not want the baby.
