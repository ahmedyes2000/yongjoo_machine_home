Sort of like a hair follicle; the genes aren't all activated, so it's only part of a human being; same with somatic cells; they only have part of a particular human's DNA.However, when 2 sets of chromosomes combine, and are fully active (as is the case at conception) you have, not a part of a human, but an entire human, for the cell is the fundamental unit of life, biologically.
