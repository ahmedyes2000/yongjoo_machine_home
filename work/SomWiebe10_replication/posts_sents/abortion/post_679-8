What if it is wrong to abort any fetus, but at the very beginning of a pregnancy it is wrong to a degree similar to that of truancy or libel and sometime later it is wrong to the same degree as accidentally causing grievous bodily injury, and somewhere near the end an abortion is truly wrong to the degree of murder?
