Its always been interesting to me, that the very people who are so strongly against abortion, are the same ones against government-funded, pre-natal care and government-sponsored health care services to the poor-including food stamps and financial help to kids who have no health insurance ! Force the poor girl who has no way to provide for the child or was rapedto the pro-lifers, it doesn't matter-she must have that unwanted child!Over population is a major threat to our world and our standard of liv-ing!
