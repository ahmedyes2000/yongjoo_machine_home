Blind Faith is a means of knowledge other than reason, pure faith is based on reason i.e. you have faith that the air you breath is beneficial to your health because of the reason that you know that the oxygen (which you take by faith to be in the air) is required for cellular respiration (a process that you also take on faith as is the case with almost all of your knowledge).metaphysics is the "study" of the theoretical especially the supernatural, and it is funny because you're trying to sound like naturalism supports your cause; furthermore the distinction between the religious and the philosophical is negligible.
