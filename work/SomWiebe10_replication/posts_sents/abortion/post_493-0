If the collective wishes to maintain the position that an unborn fetus is indeed an independent or separate life from the mother with necessary rights and liberties of its own, I would suggest the collective express their deeply-felt convictions by allowing the mother to exercise her right to distance herself from that independent or separate life regardless of its stage of development to allow it the opportunity to survive on its own as one would do for any genuinely independent "person".
