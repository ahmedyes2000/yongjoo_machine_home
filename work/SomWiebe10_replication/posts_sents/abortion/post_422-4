You just make it too easy for me. Something tells me you wouldn't know epistemology from the residue in a freshly used urinal, but the retarded and "handicapped" DO possess a rational faculty, although in varying degrees, and their rights are in fact delimited to the extent of their mental capacity, which is exactly what one would predict if man's rights are logically derived from his nature as the rational animal.
