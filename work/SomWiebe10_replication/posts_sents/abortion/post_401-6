It is different than an infant in these respects: size: a 24 week old in neonatal care is smaller than a 39 week old still in the womb development: a 24 week old in neonatal care is less developed than a 39 week old still in the womb environment: a 24 week old in neonatal care may be breathing air with lungs, but probably has a feeding tube (i.e. umbilical cord) but is otherwise identical to a 39 week old still in the womb dependency: a 24 week old in neonatal care is 100% dependent on a caregiver, just like a 39 week old in the womb, but the care is administered differentlyFor these reasons, I draw the conclusion that as soon as science can detect the organism growing inside a woman’s body, it is a life.
