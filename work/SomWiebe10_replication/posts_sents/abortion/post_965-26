Dr. Richard Land, president of The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission,said " We lose more babies through abortion every year than the total fatalities in all of the wars in which we have ever participated, commencing with the French and Indian War and including the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War I, and Gulf War II.Ó In 2005 1.2 million abortions were performed.
