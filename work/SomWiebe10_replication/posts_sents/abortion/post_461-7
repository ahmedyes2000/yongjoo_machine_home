God may judge people on the basis of nothing more than their DNA(though the Bible would seem to be evidence to the contrary) but to say that "doing" counts for nothing then perhaps we should revise our moral judgement of men like Hitler, etc. The truth is we are not passing judgement on the fetus, we are not considering their innocence or guilt, we are making a judgement about the place in our lives of an as-yet unborn fetus (I mean the first-trimester).
