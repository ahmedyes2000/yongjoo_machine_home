But as far as the rape situation, I've gone back and forth a bit thinking about it... and I just don't think that it can justify taking a human life, As horrid as that situation is. The fact that women will get illegal abortions is really not a sufficient reason to make it legal, unless there is proof that just as many abortions will occur either way.
