As to your other views, I do not believe that a fetus should have the rights of a fully-developed human being until it's systems are able to function independently outside the uterus (not get it's own bottle and change it's own diaper, but simply breathe oxygen, process food and eliminate waste independently, without reliance on its mother's body to do these things FOR it.
