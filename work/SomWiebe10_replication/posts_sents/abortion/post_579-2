The distinction I am making is between a full-term infant (or even a pre-term infant with sufficient gestational development to survive outside the womb) vs. a fetus of insufficient gestation to allow it to survive through the independent functioning of its own bodily systems in other words, a fetus which has not yet reached a point where it is viable outside of the uterus (with whatever medical interventions are available).
