I've always been as specific as necessary you on the other hand, have "spewed generalities" indirectly, at least, by assuming broad, arbitrary conditions such as "survivability".My logic is based on true axioms, and therefore is probably tertiarily axiomatic, but that's not even a logical flaw, quite the opposite actually.
