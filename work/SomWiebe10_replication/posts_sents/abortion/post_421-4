Oh, and I have successfully challenged what you have put forth of said "epistemology"; the fundamental problem is that any scenario applied to a human fetus can also be applied to a human being; even a lack of reason for that condemns the mentally retarded, even the lack of a particular ability, for it condemns the handicapped, even the issue of metaphysical independence, for you cannot prove that such is absent from a fetus nor can you prove that you possess the same without appealing to God: which would shoot yourself in the foot.
