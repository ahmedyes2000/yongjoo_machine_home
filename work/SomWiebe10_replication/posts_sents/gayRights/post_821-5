http://www.gaychristian101.com/Sodom.html If it was common knowledge in Jesus" day that Sodom was a warning against homosexual sin, then there would be abundant historical proof in the 1700+ years between the time the events of Sodom took place and the first century AD.The human authors of inspired scripture and Jewish writers outside of scripture would have identified the sin of Sodom as homosexuality.
