SidAirfoil, If you REALLY believe the bible is " God's Word" not man's and as you say " In any case, my major concern is that the source of religious moral laws (in this case, the law against homosexuality ) is god and not man", then I challenge you to explore all of the scripture that I have assembled at http://WhatkindofGod.org/ and swear on the bible that you believe all of the horrible statements attributed to " God" in the bible!
