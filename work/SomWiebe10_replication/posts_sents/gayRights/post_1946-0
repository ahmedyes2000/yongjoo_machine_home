Roman Catholics still don't eat meat on Fridays, with the exception of fish1) Actually, my entire family is Roman Catholic, a decent portion of my friends are Roman Catholic, and I have heard the priest at my Church explain multiple times the rules regarding eating meat on fridays (I guess I forgot to mention that I go to a Roman Catholic Church every Sunday).
