Who has the right to debate ME about ME? How can you tell ME I am wrong about me? I know me... even I tried to not be how I am... but after the 2nd wonderful time of being raped by God loving males who knew it was their duty to "bring me around", I let it be, I accepted me as God child, no more, no less.
