And the comment on an adultress only needing to marry the man after he gets a divorce... ludacrious ( my spelling sucks sorry) you advocate divorce so someone else can marry... are you serious that is a sorry excuse and what if he doesnt want a divorce but wants a mistress and visa versa, why cant they just be married and have legitimate, legal , and acknowledged mistress on the side who is given all the rights a married woman would have...
