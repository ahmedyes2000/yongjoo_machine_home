I do have personal standards which differ from the most common societal views, but I do not really feel compelled to demand that others change their views to be like me. As much as I'd love for us to agree about something :) Your notion that something being legal means that society "endorses" it confuses me, if you care to clarify this position I'd love to hear it.
