Hopefully you read this Jake.gay marriage = less families only if you believe that people would choose to be gay instead of heterosexual.that is, you jake, think that someone who is otherwise attracted to the opposite sex, would have had kids and raised them, will now move in with someone of the same sex and not have kids.ignoring for a moment that this isn't all together bad since there are too many people.
