In the Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 portion of the Holiness Code, God carefully places His proscription of male male sex in the context of pagan worship, Lev 18:3, taking care to mention Molech in Lev 18:21, just before prohibiting male male sex in Lev 18:22.In the Leviticus 20:13 passage, we find the same context.
