the ultimate failure of many appeals to tradition--which this is--is that it seeks to artificially define one point in human history as the golden standard against which all other periods must be measured, but ignore previous such periods, which are usually in direct contradiction to such a decision, as even a cursory review of biblical genealogy will reveal.the argument as presented amounts to little more than simple fearmongering about some cataclysimic consequences never actually identified yet which are somehow supposed to be inevitable.
