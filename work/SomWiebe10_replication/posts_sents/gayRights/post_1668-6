Marriage or the recognition of the law of energy creativity inherent in the polar opposites of male female is neccessary as a force of good energy and must be encouraged . If we passed laws according to what people'felt'and not what is creative and good we would be back in the cave . Since there is no benefit to society one has to ask why "they" want to get married,perhaps to undermine what they "hate".After all if it is simply a social recognition a personal party etc is their free choice.
