Can you juts give examples of what kind of things that kids raised by homosexual parents would struggle to understand but which kids raised by heterosexuals would find a given!?At the centre of your argument is this disturbing assumption that kids raised by heterosexuals are just better, more balanced in their general deminure, that the homosexual run household is comparable to a ghetto while the heterosexual run household is automatically more of a suburb and hence kids raised there can more easily become the president of the USA as compared to kids raised by homosexual couples simply because the one parent has a penis and the other a vulva.
