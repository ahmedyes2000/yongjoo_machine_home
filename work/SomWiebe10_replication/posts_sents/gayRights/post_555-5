But when that person begins attempting to convince others, especially those who are already psychologically vulnerable from a childhood of indoctrination in self-hatred, to do something as psychologically damaging as denying their own natural sexual orientation and trying to force themselves to be the opposite, or using emotional coercion to try to compel them into a lifetime of celibacy for which they are not emotionally suited, I have a problem with it.
