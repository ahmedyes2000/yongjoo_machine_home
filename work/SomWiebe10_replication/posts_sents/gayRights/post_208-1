Something that cracks me up is a comment about kids with divorced parents never wishing that their parents had same sex partners... watching my dad be emotionally abusive to all his girlfriends and my mom be emotionally abused by all her boyfriends, in hindsight I bet had my parents had same sex relationships things would have gone a lot smoother.
