We are all born with sinful desires but also a desire to be good... but God made a way for us to acknowledge the sinful desires (includes envy, greed, gossip, hate, homosexuality, drunkenness, lying, selfishness, pride, etc.), ask God for forgiveness (because our sin is rebellion to his authority over his creation us), and commit to changing by the power of Jesus" grace and love.
