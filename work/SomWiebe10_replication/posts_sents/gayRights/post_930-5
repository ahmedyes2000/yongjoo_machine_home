To my knowledge, no legal action has taken place against the church involved: http://www.skeptictank.org/wedband.htm http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-29802943.html The Roman Catholic Church has been denying holy orders to women and denying marriage to previously divorced persons for their entire existence in this country, and has never been the successful target of a lawsuit or prosecution for these activities.
