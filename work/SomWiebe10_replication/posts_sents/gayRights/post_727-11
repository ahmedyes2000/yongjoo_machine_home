If we say ( claim) we have not sinned, we contradict His Word and make Him out to be false and a liar, and His Word is not in us [ the divine message of the Gospel is not in our hearts].1John Chapter 2 vs.3-4And this is how we may discern [daily, by experience] that we are coming to know Him [ to perceive, recognize, understand, and become better acquainted with Him]: if we keep (bear in mind, observe, practice His teachings (precepts, commandments).
