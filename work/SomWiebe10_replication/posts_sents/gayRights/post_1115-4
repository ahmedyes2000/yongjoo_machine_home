Here are some opinions I am attempting to paraphrase from various discussion threads on this section of the opposing opinions web site: a) same-sex marriage values more than just protections; they want the "intangeables" of marriage toob) having civil unions classifying only the same-sex marriage is a fundamental inequality to marriage [which says that separate itself is unequal, and separate but equal will not be agreeable]c) most of the division on this issue is the use of the word marriage in affiliation with same-sex couples, but much fewer will have an issue with ensuring same-sex couples the same [federal/state defined] legal rights as married couples d) any argument about religious institutions not recognizing same-sex marriage is reversely encroaching upon the rights of the historical churches by state/federal involvement.
