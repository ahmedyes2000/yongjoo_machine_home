http://www.gaychristian101.com/Homosexual-Eunuchs.html Because Jesus intentionally differentiated between born eunuchs and metaphysical eunuchs who voluntarily decide not to participate in Adam and Eve style marriage, it makes sense to conclude that born eunuchs are:a. not required to participate in Adam and Eve style marriage (since Jesus intentionally opts them out)b. not required to abstain from marrying an orientation compatible partner (since Jesus intentionally differentiates them from metaphysical eunuchs who make a personal decision not to participate in Adam and Eve style marriage).
