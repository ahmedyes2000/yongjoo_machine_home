How many rich Republicans would support such " Christian conservatives" for public offices, if they were demanding that people not work, or shop, or go to entertainment events one out of seven days every week?!?In contrast to a few rare and obscure references to homosexuality in the O.Testament, the sabbath command is one of the TEN GREAT COMMANDMENTS, and the penalty required by the bible is DEATH.How many show the sincerity of their view of " God's Word" by their insistance that people either obey the 4th commandment or DIE?!?
