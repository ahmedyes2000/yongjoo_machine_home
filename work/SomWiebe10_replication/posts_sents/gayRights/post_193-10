You can argue that other alternatives to the traditional family unit are equally contra survival, perhaps even with some small merit, but that doesn't change the fact that the traditional family unit provides the best possible benefits to children . Children are not pets . I can't even begin to express how low my opinion is of anyone who would use children as bargaining chips as a way to legitimize their own lifestyle choices.
