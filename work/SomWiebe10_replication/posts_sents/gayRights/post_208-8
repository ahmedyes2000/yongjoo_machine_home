My Questions for You: *Do gay people really wish gay-dom on their children, knowing the adversity they may face in their future?*Isn't being molested as a young person more likely to effect your sexuality (in any regard) in your future more so than having two loving parents who happen to be of the same sex?* Do you think that adopted children are thinking "my parents are pushing their gay agenda down my throat and that is too heavy a burden for [me] to carry and it is in my opinion criminal" (according to Hope7) or do you think they are thinking "hey i have two parents who love me, awesome"...
