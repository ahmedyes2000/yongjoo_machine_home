the Christian gay that believes he's doing the right thing and is going to go to heaven is being deceived, and without fully seeing their sin and repenting of it... they are heading toward sorrow and suffering, whether they love God or not, He loves them, too, and doesn't want that to be their future, but He can't allow them into His presence unless there has been repentance and forgiveness.
