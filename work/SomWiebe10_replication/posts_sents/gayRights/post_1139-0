 And I believe based on all the literature Ive read and the behaviors Ive seen and experienced from the homosexual community is the only reason, besides the sad attempt to destroy the concept of a moral institution we call holy matrimony, is to adopt little children . You say you doubt that the men I mentioned above could all be homosexual,despite their own admissions and sexual appetities, but you are very wrong, they were, by all standards set by those in the homosexual community are homosexual according to the misguided information that homosexuality is not a choice to be made but a born condition,something that despite the fact we have free will they have no CONTROL over and are subject to its every whim, despite genetic proof, so if anyone did live out their homosexual fantasies that would make them homosexual by definition of the homosexual community.
