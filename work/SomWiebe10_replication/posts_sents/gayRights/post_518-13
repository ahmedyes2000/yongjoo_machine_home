From the friendships I've had with Gay men and women since my high school days in the 60's, I firmly believe that a truly Gay person cannot change who they are but can choose not to have sexual contact with members of the same sex, just like I can choose not to cheat on my wife if I'm physically attracted to another women, an attraction over which I have no control.
