If I was you Id grow and take your life into your own hands and make up with her even if you know she will never be reliable as a mother because someday she wont be there and you will regret not having had the nerve to walk up to her and say I FORGIVE YOU MOM... and until then dont blame the world for your chips and insecurities...
