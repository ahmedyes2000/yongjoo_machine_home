"The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, "This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man. " For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.
