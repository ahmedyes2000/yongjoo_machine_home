I am a practicing Catholic, and I wholeheartedly side with my church on issues of incest and polygamy, but I cannot ask my government to make laws against them, for my beliefs in their immorality are founded in religious dogma, not secular reason, and as such, it would be unjust, and un-Christian, of me to force my religious dogma upon other people.
