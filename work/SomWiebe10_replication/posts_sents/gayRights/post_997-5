I also have deep rooted Christian beliefs I'm 22, saving for marriage , (though I refuse to marry until everyone in my country is granted that right guess I'll be a virgin for a long time, hahaha) and I have a lot of strong Christian beliefs however, bagpiper2005, I agree that my personal beliefs should not prohibit anyone from loving whoever makes them happy and marriage may be somewhat of a farce as of late (Celebrities are making marriage into a fad, it seems, what with the constant divorce rates and all that lovely jazz), but when I think of "marriage" I think of happy people committing to loving one another for the rest of their lives and the prospect of this right being denied to anyone makes me scoff.
