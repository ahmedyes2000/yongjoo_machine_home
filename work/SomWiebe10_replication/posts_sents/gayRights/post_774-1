Mr. Rick Brentlinger wrote in response to point a): "a) GodÕs exclusive design of male and female relationships as stated in GenesisGod never says or implies in the Genesis historical account, that his anatomical design of males and females requires ONLY male-female partnerships or that male-male and female-female partnerships draw His wrath" >My objection:Perhaps you missed the fact that Leviticus 20:13(Lev 20:13) If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.
