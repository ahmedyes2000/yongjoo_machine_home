The minimization of Scripture; the pompous belief that man has Truth, or at least has the capability of finding Truth; that we as people are born "good"; that there is no "right" or "wrong" in this world; that there is no afterlife, or consequences for our current behaviors or liefstyles--these are all consequences of modern thoughts/beliefs.
