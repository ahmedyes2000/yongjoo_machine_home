Usually, males get mostly "lust for female" genes and females get mostly "lust for male" genes, but sometimes, due to chromosome crossovers or other events during the genetic shuffle in the formation of a sperm, a male (Y) sperm may get mostly "lust for male" genes or a female (X) sperm mostly "lust for female" genes.
