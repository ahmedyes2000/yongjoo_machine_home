No part of this entire rant applies exclusively to homosexuals (which is to say it is a statement that could be made to any couple regardless of the couples gender).“The moment you say you should be allowed to impose your will on another, you will fnd me in adament opposition to your position.”How is this imposing anyone’s will on you?“Do what you like as long as you do me no harm in the process, and leave children alone.”So children should not be placed in potentially loving homes?
