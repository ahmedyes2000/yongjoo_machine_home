This is similar to the survival advantage brought by menopause, where women lose their reproductive capability after it becomes unsafe for them to reproduce… yet they are still able to care for children .“If homosexuals were left to their own, literally, they would eventually cease to exist, unless within their confines they abandoned their sexual practices and reverted to normal reproductive sexual intercourse.”It is true that if you were to place a population of homosexuals on an island and then come back in a hundred years you would likely not find anyone alive.
