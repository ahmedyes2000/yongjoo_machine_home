i think if we're to reach this community, it needs to be done with love and in such a way that it comes across as that they are truly loved by ourselves and more importantly by Him, but its the lifestyle that is unhealthy and will ultimately lead to death.like i said before, i know i was deceived for a long time, but i think its because i kept hanging onto other sins in my life, and once i gave everything over to Him i was finally able to start to be healed in every area.so, yeah... it's the prayer of realizing our sin, and the resulting deliverance from it.
