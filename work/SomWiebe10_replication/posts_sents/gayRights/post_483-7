My point was that, while each of us lands somewhere upon the continuum between "gay" and "straight, " and cannot change our orientation, still some of us, as a function of where we land, experience sexual attraction as something which is primarily directed towards people of the opposite gender to our own, while some of us experience it as something which is primarily directed towards people of our own gender, and still others experience it as a "choice" in that they find themselves attracted to people of either gender.
