your exact words are "children who grow up in any other family form single parent family, divorced, step family, or co-habiting parents dont" do as well by up to half in these measures compared to children living with their own married mother and father" I don't think that having same sex parents are any different then having opposite sex parents, ok, yeah their the same sex, they have the same parts, but it doesn't matter.
