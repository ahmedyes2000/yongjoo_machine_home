Personally, I think hate crimes are a decent measure of how society responds to homosexuality: http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm (Table 1 for each year under Hate Crimes section) As you'll notice, hate crimes have neither had a dramatic increase or drop since 1995, suggesting that tolerance may only be getting slightly better (if we account for the population increase, though we have to counterbalance for cities lost within the samples).
