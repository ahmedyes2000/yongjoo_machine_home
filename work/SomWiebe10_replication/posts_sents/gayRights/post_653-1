it's hard on both sides... trying to convince a gay Christian that they're heading for trouble (as they should know they are if they know their bible and what the scriptures clearly state), or the non-Christian gay, as they may not necessarily see the need for Christ in their life, if they haven't been explained to the reasons why we need Jesus as our personal Savior.that's why i feel its crucial that the right witness is sent into the lives of both Christian and non, as there is so much anger towards Jesus and the " Christian" community, due largely to the wrong type of witnessing and preaching by those that attend glbt parades, festivals and events to "spread the Gospel".i know, having attended the pride parades before, that the " Christians" that show up to these events are(more often than not) red-faced, veins bulging in their foreheads, screaming at these people messages of damnation, which i definitely feel is the wrong approach.the world is so used to Christians who use these methods, and when they see them doing that, they think "why would i want to live like that" or "that's what Jesus is all about?
