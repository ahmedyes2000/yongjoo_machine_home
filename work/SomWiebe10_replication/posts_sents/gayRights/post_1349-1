In my life I've seen children and teens be much better adjusted because they've had to go through not only the normal chaos of childhood with other children calling names and being mean but they've also had to go through what I might call an orientation that very few kids have... and that is that prejudice, hatred and a lack of understanding for the human condition so thoroughly exists in this world.
