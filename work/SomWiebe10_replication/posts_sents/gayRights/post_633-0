i only know what i believe, and what the Lord has laid on my heart... my prayer for the gay Christian is that the Lord will lift the veil of deceit that the enemy has placed over their eyes and heart in regards to their personal relationship with the Lord.i know that i believed for the longest time, as i was fence-sitting in my faith, that " God knew where my heart was", which is true, but at the same time, God can't and won't allow sin into heaven.
