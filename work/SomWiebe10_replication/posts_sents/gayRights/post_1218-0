This article claims that children raised by two moms or two dads are more likely to engage in early sex, do drugs, drop out, etc. Can this be blamed on the fact that the child was raised without a mom AND a dad or on the fact that society is so intolerant that constant ostracizing has led the child down the wrong path?
