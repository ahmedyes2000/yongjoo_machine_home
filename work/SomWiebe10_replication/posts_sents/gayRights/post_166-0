The question of advantage or disadvantage might more appropriately be asked about same race (of the child’s, each other, yours or predominate in their society), same religion (of the child’s parents, each other, yours, predominate in their society or the true one), income of parents, assets of parents, quality of neighborhood…Why limit your inquiry to this issue unless you have a transparent agenda of a particular group you wish to discriminate against?
