So, yes, whether being gay is 100% genetic (unlikely) or involves some environmental (probably intrauterine) influences upon the fetus" early development, I do believe that people are born gay (or straight, or somewhere along the continuum between the two, as determined by their specific genetic makeup and any environmental influences which have been exerted upon that genetic makeup) and that this sexual orientation is immutable.
