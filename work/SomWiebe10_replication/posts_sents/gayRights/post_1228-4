The issue I have, though, is that elevating same-sex marriage to be the same as traditional marriage further denies the inherent differences between the sexes (the denial of which has already damaged society) and denies the ability of society to say that, wherever possible, a traditional married couple is preferred over all other options because of its proven superiority as a method of raising children.
