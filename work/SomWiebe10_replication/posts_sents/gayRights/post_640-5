I've asked a couple guys living in that lifestyle, about if they felt like men (even at an early age) and if they ever felt like they had to measure up to what they feel being a man is ( I know that was my case and as I mentioned before, plus I've asked other men who live in the gay lifestyle, and they could relate to me).
