I'm also astonished by people who use the Bible as an expression of God's will so easily ignore the things that don't trouble them, like Paul's instruction that women should cover their heads in church (and keep their mouths shut, by the way), while being so certain that homosexuality is a sin and going to great lengths to shame, stereotype (in many cases, commit false witness against intentionally, or, through their lack of education about these issues, unintentionally), and discriminate against gays and lesbians.
