but if i called you out on a sin, acknowledging that i too need accountability in my life for sins, than i am not judging.in fact if you are a christian, i have a right to call you out on doing something wrong just like you have a right to call me out (1 corinthians 5:12, proverbs 27:17).if you are not a christian which i am not saying you are either way, cause i don't know but if you're not, and you are offended by what i have written, i am sorry for offending you.
