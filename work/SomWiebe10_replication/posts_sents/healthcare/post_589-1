The money for it has to come from somewhere, and that of course is from taxes... and as Government involvement in the health care industry has only made things worse overall and not better, I don't see how it's possible that 1) giving them even more power will make anything better, and 2) that it's justified to implement this policy at the expense of both the sick and the healthy.
