You could translate the Preamble to like this:More perfect Union = Better than EnglandEstablish Justice = Establish JusticeInsure domestic Tranquility = Peaceful Provide for the common defence = one army to defend (i.e. not controlling) Promote the general Welfare = all laws/regulations should not harm the countrySecure the Blessing of Liberty = Freedom for AllIf the government followed those guidelines for every law/regulation they form, they will be on their way to being Constitutional.
