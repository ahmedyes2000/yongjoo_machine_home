Like the fact that the new (potential) sugar tax would increase prices for the cheapest foods thus making it even more difficult for the lower class to afford food ? I agree the free market is not the answer to everything but with a little regulation (far less than we currently have today), the free market does make products and services available to everyone and keep prices down better than price caps (those have side affects).
