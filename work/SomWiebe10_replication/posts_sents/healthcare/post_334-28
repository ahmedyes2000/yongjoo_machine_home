To Bobby Jindal, who said" Republicans believe in a simple principle:  no Americans should have to worry about losing their health care coverage.  Period.  We stand for universal access to affordable health care coverage. What we oppose is universal government-run health care.  Health care decisions should be made by doctors and patients, not by government bureaucrats. We believe Americans can do anything.   And if we put aside partisan politics and work together, we can make our system of private medicine affordable and accessible for every one of our citizens.
