The Dr. gets a check for $19.20, must write of $76, the patient is billed $54.80Who do you think wins here, right, the Government should, only they have paid out double or triple just to process these small checks!!When you have to call Medicare with a question, and trust me this happens frequently, you are only allowed to ask 3 questions, if you have 4 questions, you can ask the 3 and then hang up and call back, wait on hold another 45 minutes to ask the 4th question.
