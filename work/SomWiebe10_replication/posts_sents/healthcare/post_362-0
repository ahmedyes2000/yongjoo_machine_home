"Morality ends where a gun begins" Ayn RandOn what basis does one call government-run "universal health care" "the moral thing to do"?It is only the morality of altruism... the creed that holds individual human sacrifice for a "higher" purpose as the standard of the good... that can sanction any proposal to force others to act against his own will, judgement, and self-interest.
