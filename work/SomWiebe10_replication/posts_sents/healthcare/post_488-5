I did not go to the doctor every time I had a runny nose, and if I did have to have a surgery or other major medical procedure, yes I would need to be scheduled in, but after now being in the civilian world, I find that I still have to schedule to have major medical procedures done, but at a much larger cost to me (with private insurance).
