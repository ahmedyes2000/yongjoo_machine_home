--Casey--As evidence that teaching ID promotes religion, AUSCS claims that “Phillip Johnson, the so-called ‘father of Intelligent Design,’ once told a religious audience that his goal is to use ID to instill doubt about evolution in people's minds and then introduce them to ‘the truth’ of Jesus Christ.”AUSCS, an organization that often gets involved with litigation, should know that this argument would never pass muster in a court of law: This is a mere anecdotal assertion that someone “once told a religious audience” about alleged religious motivations, and no quotes or documentation are provided by AUSCS to verify the quote.
