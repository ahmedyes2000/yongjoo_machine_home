Behe was forced to write a laughable response ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/post/PLNK3U696N278Z93O ) that dodged the implications (evolution even in a limited lab population can produce a new beneficial system, i.e. an improvement that was not "degradative"), but, as per his modus operandi, he will dance and redefine his terms rather than admit that his argument against evolution has been falsified.
