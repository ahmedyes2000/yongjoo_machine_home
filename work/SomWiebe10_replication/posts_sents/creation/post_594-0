-- It seems to me that Luskin is being "more scientific" in that he talks about a method for testing ID--That's ironic because Luskin presents no testable ID. Although I understand your confusion where ID claims that showing that a gap in our ignorance, which has been defined to be "design", should count as a way to test "ID".
