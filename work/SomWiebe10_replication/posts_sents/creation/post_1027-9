Every single individual life is wildly improbable (think about all the sperm cells that could have reached your mom's egg) however, once again when we look at the whole picture we see that life did have to happen, it just happened to take this form.idk, maybe what pisses me off is the harsh reaction to the idea of ID.I think the claims you've heard about the "harsh reaction" to ID have been either exaggerated, or flat out fabricated.
