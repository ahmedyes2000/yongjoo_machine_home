However, Keith Robison described a very similar example where simple evolutionary processes lead to a system which is IC ( http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/behe/review.html ) So, duplication plus a loss of function, plus one of two different loss-of-function mutations can convert a single step pathway into a two step cascade.
