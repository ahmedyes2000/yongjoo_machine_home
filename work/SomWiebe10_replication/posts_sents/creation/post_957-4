What good is faith with the presence of evidence, why do we rely on hard evidence, God says believe and you shall see my kingdom, of course people would come to jesus with evidence in their hands, but thats our main test here on earth, God is looking for those who will believe in him without seeing him, clinging to the promise of going to heaven one day and to conclude i just have to say that we are creation and nothing can change that.
