Indeed the Greeks were very close to showing that the Earth revolved around the sun, put off only because they had miscalculated the size of the universe (lacking telescopes they could not correctly calculate stellar distances using parallax)Òdescriptions of the process of water evaporation and clouds..ÓWhich can easily be observed by the people at that time, Aristotle himself gave crude descriptions of cloud formation processes.Òit goes directly against God's purposes... as I mentioned to you before it is necessary for God to maintain "plausible deniability"..
