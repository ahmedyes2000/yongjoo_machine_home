So your argument is, by pushing scientists to find more junk DNA (it is, in fact, useless to the organism,) vestigial limbs (my tailbone does nothing and has no purpose, and I could have it removed with no damage to my functioning,) and other disproofs of Intelligent Design, ID serves the purpose of annoying scientists into progress?
