I know it's common for you guys (Musgrave is someone who comes to mind) to accuse us of moving the goalposts when we point out any straw men you've used, but if you want to state the early drafts promoted a religious idea, then fail to provide the evidence to back this up, then insist the religious content is there, we just need to "read between the lines, " and finally accuse me of moving the goalposts, that's fine.
