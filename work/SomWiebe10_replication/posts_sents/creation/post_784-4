If a religious source that cannot be supported otherwise is valid to you then what would you say to a Taoist that supports their arguments by relying on their holy texts?“If a man (or woman) says that he loves God and believes in Him as the Center of his life, then he will not have any problem using that book to help him support his viewpoint.”This is all well and good when talking among other Christians , but it comes across as ‘God did it’ when talking with those outside of Christiantiy.
