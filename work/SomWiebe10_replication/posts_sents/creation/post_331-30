Or to the points I originally brought up here: http://www.opposingviews.com/comments/that-comment-was-a-fraud For most part, I'm not sure what to say about religion or your description of it's reasoning, but if religion is to be defined solely as anything that goes against the truth, then could one argue that views in science that are later falsified (but still held by many) are essentially religion by definition?
