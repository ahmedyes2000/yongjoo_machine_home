So I'm assuming that when the nylonase only had 2% the efficiency of typical enzymes, it was because we just didn't have the right environment for the bacteria, am I right?http://209.85.173.132/search?q=cache:MX7Px_DB75IJ: www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm +nylonase+ evolution +The+new+enzymes+are+very+inefficient+(having+only+2%25+of+the+efficiency+of+the+regular+enzymes)&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us"and a remarkable mutation which caused the bacteria to feast on the citrate" This is only a fraction of the whole equation, did the bacteria retain the same efficiency?
