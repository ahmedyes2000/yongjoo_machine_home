Crucially, he predicted that additional homologies would be found between components of the F-type ATPase and the flagellar protein export apparatus, for example between the b subunit of the ATPase and Fli H and between the delta subunit and Fli J. In 2006, I confirmed one of Nick's hunches through homology searches, showing that part of Fli H was homologous to the b subunit.
