but it really isn'tFirst off the statement "And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made" only at first appears that he took 7 days... just read the sentence again he rested on the seventh day... just the same as in the other verse... no conflict it's just the wording of "On the seventh day God finished his work"..
