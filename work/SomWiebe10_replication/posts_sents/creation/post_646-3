So far all I can find says otherwise:It's not the same as the "watchmaker" argument: http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&id=795 The drafts specifically state that while some master intellect is the "creator" behind life, it would be impossible to tell if the "creator" is natural or supernatural: http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&id=796 Here's another passage which states that commenting on the supernatural has no place in science: http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&id=797 If you could find passages in the early drafts of Pandas in which God is SPECIFICALLY implicated in the use of the term "creator" then I would be wrong.
