Michelangelo DÕAgostino " In the matter of Berkeley v. Berkeley", Berkeley Science Review, issue 10, spring 2006Now remember that Johnson has described quite accurately the goal of ID ÒOur strategy has been to change the subject a bit so that we can get the issue of intelligent design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools.Ó--Source: American Family Radio, Jan 10, 2003 broadcast, in which Johnson Òdiscusses his book The Right Questions, encouraging Christians to actively debate issues of eternal value.ÓVarious other ID proponents have similarly come to this conclusion, not only arguing that the issue of ID is not really about science, since ID lacks much of any scientific foundation allowing it to be a scientific hypothesis, but also that it is all about religion.
