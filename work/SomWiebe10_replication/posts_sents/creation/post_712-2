Or, if it took six whole days to create the earth, would the creator have had time to create all the rest, I mean, some of these galaxies are awfully huge and with a lot of intricatekly moving interstellar dust and radiation that had to be started off precesly right to fool modern astronomers?3) Why did the creator go to all this trouble to conceal the evidence behind a massive cover-up of radiological datings, cosmic radiation and, well, essentially the entire findings of geology and astronomy as supported by chemistry and physics?4) Why create all the "kinds" of animals during these days, and then conceal this astounding fact behind what to evolutionary biologists and paleontologists seem an amazingly consistent set of interlocking facts from genetics, behaviour, morphology, biogeography, extinctions, speciations, fossils records, epidemiology and immunology that fits with life evolving according to rather well understood processes?5) Why were so much of this omitted from the Bible?
