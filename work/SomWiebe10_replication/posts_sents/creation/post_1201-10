Micro evolution yes, girraffes necks might have grown longer over time to better enable them to reach tree branches, a cheetah's sense of sight and smell could have developed over time to make him a better hunter, and humans might have less body hair than our ancestors thanks to airconditioning/heating and the fact we now live indoors and wear more cloths.
