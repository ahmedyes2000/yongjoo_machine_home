But then he provided the final piece in the jigsaw (and Nick Matzke's ears should prick up at this point)!Namba and colleagues have now solved the structure of Fli J, another protein that interacts with Fli I and Fli H. And what they found was clear evidence of homology with yet another protein from the F-type ATPase--the gamma subunit!--So in other words, science supported two predictions by Nick Matzke and showed how Flil was not an essential part of flagellar function, even though knocking it out would prevent the flagellum from forming, when in addition to Flil also Fli H was knocked out, the flagellum formed.
