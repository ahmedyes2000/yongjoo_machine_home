What is it with people like you ? was the bible the first book you read and then you quit reading anything else ? Can you defend your position WITHOUT reference to the bible ? Do you have any evidence, yes EVIDENCE, from another source that shows the bible is the word of God and not just a collection of books selected by the Vatican to support a particular viewpoint ? Why do you find it easier to believe in some all powerful supernatural creator that is eternal than a natural universe that is eternal ? Is it possible to prove (without reference to your book) that God exists, or does not exist ? probably not.
