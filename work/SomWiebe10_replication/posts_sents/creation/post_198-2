I am very aware of my "concession" namely that it is not just the religious motivations of ID which disqualifies ID as having merit as a science, it's the lack of scientific contributions (the examples you mention have little or no relevance to the concept of ID but are at best examples of " ID proponents can also do real science") which dooms ID to a lack of merit as a scientific contribution.
