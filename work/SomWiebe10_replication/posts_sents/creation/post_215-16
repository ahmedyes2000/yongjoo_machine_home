Also in amphioxus there is an Ig protein which is used in innate immunity (the Variable Domain Chitin Binding proteins) that was known in 2004 (in 2006 a protein that is a very similar to the T Cell Receptor and is involved in innate immunity was found in the amphioxus, be here I'm dealing with 2004 knowledge relevant to Behe's testimony).
