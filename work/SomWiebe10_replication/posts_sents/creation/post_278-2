Just because something arises spontaneously doesn't disprove a designer--true, but as science has shown, the designer need not always be an intelligent entity and in fact, this confusion about design which lies at the foundation of apparent versus actual design has not been resolved by the eliminative approach chosen by ID. It has nothing to do with a believe in a designer, a perhaps innate, evolved aspect of humans, but all to do with what is scientifically supportable.
