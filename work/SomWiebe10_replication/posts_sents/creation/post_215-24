Let me repeat this, Luskin is using a paper that reports that a) Lampreys have an adaptive immune system and b) the Lamprey genome does not adaptive immunoglobulin genes, and then discoverers the mechanisms that produce adaptive immunity (a novel variant of an innate immunity mechanism) to claim that we have no accounts of how Ig molecules could have evolved.
