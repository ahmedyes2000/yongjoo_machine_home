In at least the cases of PCP and 2,4-DNT, the breakdown pathways have multiple required parts, and therefore ought to be considered irreducibly complex (except that Behe will often dodge here also and invoke a "strict" definition of IC which excludes metabolic pathways, a definition which he invokes only when convenient, and which is arbitrary because the IC argument really only relies on the "multiple required features, too improbable to evolve at once" logic; in other situations he and his allies have declared various metabolic pathways to be IC when it seems to help the argument).
