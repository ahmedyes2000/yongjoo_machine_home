And listen, I have read the silly bible probably a dozen times growing up, I was raised Ultra super religious, church 6 days a week, I took 18 credits in religious studies at a very good University, I dated a Baptist preachers daughter all through high school and not only had to sit through the lame sermons, but had to discuss the meanings for hours and hours and hours.
