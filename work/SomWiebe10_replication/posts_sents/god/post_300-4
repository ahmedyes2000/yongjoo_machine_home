Many more people than you would think have dabbled and even practiced witchcraft and even lesser evils, be it for pleasure or for serious worship and have found this underworld to be wicked and criminal in more ways than one and have little resource as to how to get out of such a mind-controling anti religious group/groups and Dr. Brown attempts to show people what that world does to innocent victims and how it operates and how unknowing youth are falling into its spiritual warfare and are finding it to be a battle they dont know how to win or even begin to fight against.
