This is not to say that such constructs have no value There are many theoretical constructs that we put to everyday use Ð electricity, atoms, electrons, etc. I find it very difficult to justify making an unmanageable, invisible, and unobservable phenomenon so much a part of what motivates people to think and behave as they do.
