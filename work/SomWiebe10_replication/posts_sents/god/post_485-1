Utnapishtim ( I definitely don't remember how to spell his name ) tells Gilgamesh a story of how he obtained eternal life through surviving a flood that killed all men across the earth except for those that had been on the boat which I believe were his family and some animals ... that is a poem from Mesopotamia which I believe held the worlds first civilization, the Sumerians.
