Indeed, one of the many things I find absurd about Christianity (and Islam, for that matter) is the absurd credit they give to humanity, as if the maker of heaven and earth had any reason to become man--the Islamic version of this vanity is that Satan fell out of resentment for the grand destiny that Allah had apportioned to human beings.
