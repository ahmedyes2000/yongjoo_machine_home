-between giggles-okay, ignoring nearly every sentence you wrote is wrong,dumb,misrpresentation,or some hilarious combination of those things, I want to focus on the funniest presumption I've ever come across (and I read nearly all of Joe's posts, at least he's funny on purpose) " Jesus is great, but He's not God" (an illogical argument) Please, please explain to me in logical terms, why it's illogical to think that Jesus is great, but not god.
