There is no point in me trying to guess how it all started (though I imagine it was from an inherent need within born of self-realization to not cease to exist at some point, which is not even the theory I put forth, but there you go) As I was saying, there is no point for me trying to guess though how it all started, and I don't care how or why it all started.
