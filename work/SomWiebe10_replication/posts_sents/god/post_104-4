I have studied evolutionary theory in depth at university level, and I notice that most people who respond to discussions such as this one either do not even know the basics of evolution, or have extremely limited knowledge of peer-reviewed, published research done on intelligent design, and thus make ignorant assumptions and statements regarding intelligent design.
