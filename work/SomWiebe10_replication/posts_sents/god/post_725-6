I think while many aspects of religion, indeed most, encourage good behaviour, I believe taking the easy-out of describing to the religious masses that the reason this optimal behaviour is desirable as "uh, uh, because god said so" encourages stupidity and a lack of reflection,which while in many cases leads to a group of people who act properly in society,at the same time makes it really easy to get them to do ridiculous things like blow up buildings in the name of allah, or crusade against the middle east in the name of god.
