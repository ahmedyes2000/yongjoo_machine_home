It would hardly be surprising that Jerusalem would have had a secure source of water, in case of a siege, and the bible mentioning a real structure hardly makes the rest of the book correct (you might as well argue that since " Harry Potter" mentions King's Cross Station, then the books must be true, because the station also exists; come to think of it, I have been to King's Cross and seen a wall between platforms 9 and 10 marked platform 9 3/4, with a trolley embedded in the wall-so they must be true!).
