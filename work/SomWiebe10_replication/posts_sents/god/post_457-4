If God loves us and have the abilty to see the future, why did he create us humans when he knew that we would eventually become bad and punish those bad humans by flooding the land ? If God have the ability to see the future why did he create lucifer when he knew that lucifer one day will betray him and god will punish him by banishing to hell ? And why did god put the tree of "not sure what is it called'in the garden of Eden where Adam and Mary lived.
