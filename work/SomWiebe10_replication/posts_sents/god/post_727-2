I am not certain if I am saying that Eastern and other faiths are based more on "philosophy, " just that their ethical structures are not necessarily a black-and-white list of "thou shalt not"s. They are frequently presented more as broad precepts to be applied situationally rather than as hard-as-fast rules about certain proscribed behaviors.
