BLIND Oh the pursuits of the flesh This shell that covers self The fix of desire until the next crave So shallow this fix, never to last Brief satisfaction; my cup now empty This flesh aches between each thirst Day after day the endless search; cup in hand What elixir will fill this cup and empty not The sweet savor that quenches my desire Light begins to dim on this ragged shell This flesh shriveled from the tick of time Cup after cup filled up; folly for the fool The spirit lay bleached to bone white Picked clean from neglect Left to rot in the hot desert wind of life The spirit left alone, forgotten and unwanted Never watered or nurtured; void of light Cast to the shadows to wither on the vine Oh what a wasteland that I made of this spirit For it is I, the spirit, that was starved until death A lifetime to quicken my spirit has cost me the prize
