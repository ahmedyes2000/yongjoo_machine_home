We can observe the chemical composition of distant stars, and even observe the motion of planets as they orbit other stars.“We see things on such a small scale that most of the things we have proven may not conform to the rest of the universe.”As stated above… what we observe is consistent, the laws we see here on earth are the same laws found in the Andromeda galaxy and beyond.“We don't even know what is at the very bottom of our own oceans how can we claim that we know if there is a divine being or not.”Yes, but that same logic says we cannot claim that there are no elves.“There is no proof on either side just because there is a god does not disprove science and vice-versa.”Science is just a process, not really something that can be proven or disproved.
