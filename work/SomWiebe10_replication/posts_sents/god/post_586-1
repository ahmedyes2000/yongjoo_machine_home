The argument is silly since using any word but "objective evil" defeats it (pain, suffering, collectively agreed upon evil, etc.) Put 100 devout people in separate rooms and ask them 100 moral questions (e.g. if a pregnant woman has cancer, can she get chemotherapy to likely save her life if it would likely kill the baby?)
