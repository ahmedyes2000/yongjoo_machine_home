I have no problem with people accepting the possibility that either religion or science is the answer, but people like this, the ones who deny any other reasoning, who make pathetic arguments for their side, despite tangible evidence of any kind, that really grate on me. God is simply another form of control that drones follow without question, because they are too foolish to question authority.
