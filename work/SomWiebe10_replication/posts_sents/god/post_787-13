Now, Messenger, by his/her near retarded statement skips over every step of logic a third grader would accidently use, and goes straight to " Jesus did say he was the son of god, (ignoring whether he ever lived, and whether he ever said that) and therefore, he either must be the son of god, or he was crazy for saying it (even though he may or may not have said it, and may or may not have existed) therefore, he could not have said it and not been the son of god and be a great man. " So, according to Messenger's infintile logic, Jesus is either the son of god, or a crazy person.
