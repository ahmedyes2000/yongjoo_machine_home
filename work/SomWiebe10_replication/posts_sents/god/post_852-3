I just feel as if there is less and less reason for me to buy into the snake oil that organized religions try to sell me. I feel very good about my beliefs(or lack thereof) they feel right to me. However, I am not the stereotypical depressed, bitter atheist that you may see in your mind's eye-far from it, in fact.
