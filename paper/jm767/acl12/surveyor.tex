\begin{abstract}
We describe Surveyor, a system that automatically generates surveys of
collections of papers that represent scientific domains. Surveyor
extracts the main contributions of the underlying articles by
using heterogeneous sources: source texts and citations.  Using
Surveyor, we generate summaries of 10 topics in Natural Language
Processing corresponding to 10 chapters from the Jurafsky and Martin
textbook \emph{Speech and Language Processing}~\cite{JurafskyM08}. We evaluate the generated
summaries by comparing them to end-of-chapter summaries and
historical notes from the textbook and show that using heterogeneous
sources results in higher Rouge scores than state-of-art
summarization systems.
