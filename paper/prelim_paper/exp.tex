\section{Experiments}

\subsection{PP attachemnt dataset}


1) baseline: backoff method

2) tumbl, randomly pick labeled examples

3) active learning

Todo: describe baseline, describe experiment settings

plot accuracy of 3 methods with different training size
%We use the backoff method \cite{} as our baseline, which is one of the that
%doesn't require.


\subsection{Named Entity Classification}

1) describe task and dataset

2) describe baseline DLCoTrain

3) experiment with NEC data

4) experiment DLCoTrain and tumbl on ppattach set

5) analysis


\subsection{AAN Terminology Extraction}

Not sure about this, if time is limited, show only preliminary
results, no comparison w/ other methods.
