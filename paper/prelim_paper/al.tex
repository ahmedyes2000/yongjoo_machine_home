\section{Active Learning}


Observations in a pilot experiment on the
preporsitional phrase attachment dataset motivated applying 
active learning.
In this section, we first briefly describe the PP
attachment classification task, dataset, and results form the pilot experiment.
Then we present the active learning algorithm.

\subsection{PP Attachment Dataset}\label{ppdata}

1) ppattach disambiguation

2) dataset

3) state-of-art, backoff method

\subsection{Pilot Experiment}

use basic tumbl model

plot: learning curve from 10 to 1000 training size 

plot: uncertianty - when sample size is small (e.g. 10 , 50) performance

variance is large, motivate a method to better choose examples to be labeled


\subsection{Algorithm with Active Learning}

// need to fill in after experiments
