\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
We introduce a general framework of semi-supervised graphical model that is
applicable to any classification tasks that can be represented with norminal
features, requiring only a handhul of labeled examples.
We conducted experiments on three different NLP tasks: prepositional phrase 
attachment, named entity classification, and domain-specific terminology extraction. 
We show both theoretically and empirically how the graph structure helps making 
use of large amount of unlabeled data.
Based on the empirically study of underlying correlations between graph structures and
classification performance, we incorporate active learning techniques to 
achieve the best learning rate with minimum requirement on labeled data.
