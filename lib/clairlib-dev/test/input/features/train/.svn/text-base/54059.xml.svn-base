So if Potvin can pound on Dino, what happens when Dino pounds 
on him?  If Dino gets his legs slashed, can he slash Potvin
in return?  This year at a UM-LSSU hockey game, a UM player
was called for a slash when he hit the goalie's glove with
his stick.  Is that slashing, while hitting someone's ankles
isn't?  How do the refs know what to call?  Do the goalies
get more liberties than other players?
