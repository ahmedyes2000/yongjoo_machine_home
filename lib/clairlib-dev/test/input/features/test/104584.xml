I'm no Kingman fan.  Just thought I'd point out that he's the
only player in history to have five three-HR games.  Joe Carter
has four.  Eddie Murray three.  McCovey and Gehrig also three.
Ruth, Mays, Foxx and Dawson two each.

I don't think Reggie's WS game counts, else I believe he would 
also have had two.
