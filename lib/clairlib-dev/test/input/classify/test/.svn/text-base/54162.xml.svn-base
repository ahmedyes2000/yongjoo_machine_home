ST>         as for more captain trivia, the next Edmonton
ST>         catain was Lee Fogilin who was later traded to
ST>         the Buffalo Sabres, after him was Wayne Gretzky
ST>         who w   traded to L A, then came Kevin Low who
ST>         nly this year was traded to the N Y Rangers
 
Wasn't Mark Messier Captain of the oilers before Kevin Lowe?
But, of course, he was traded as well -- so your point of every
Oilers captain being traded is still true.
