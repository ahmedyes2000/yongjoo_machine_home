	Relying on Canadian tourists and transplanted Northeasterners to
support a team in Miami is crazy; espaecially when you have really deserving 
cities without a team such as San Diego & Milwaukee. I wish the Panthers or
whatever their name is well but if they can't sell to Hispanics, they're in
deep doo-doo. Already, there are rumors that Tampa may move to Milwaukee.
