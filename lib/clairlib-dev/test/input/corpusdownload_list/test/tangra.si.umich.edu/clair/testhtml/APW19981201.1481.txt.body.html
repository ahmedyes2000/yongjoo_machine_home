<HTML>    NEW YORK AP  There's nothing all those well-programmed figure skaters like less than ad-libbing. Each of their regimented precisely choreographed on-ice practice sessions is designed to make automatic every spin every jump every move.    All of which should make Thursday night's Improv-Ice entertaining and unpredictable.    Twelve of the world's most accomplished skaters will compete at the Centrum in Worcester Massachusetts without knowing what routine they're performing until one hour before they hit the ice.    ``I thought `Wouldn't it be fun to do something that a lot of clubs do to try to promote individuality and spontaneity from skaters and do it with the established stars'' said Robin Cousins the 1980 Olympic champion who came up with the Improv-Ice format and is producing the event. ``We'll have them go out on a limb and instantly create.''    On hand will be Olympic champions Kristi Yamaguchi and Viktor Petrenko; U.S. champions Nancy Kerrigan Rosalynn Sumners Nicole Bobek and Rudy Galindo; current world champion Alexei Yagudin; Philippe Candeloro; Brian Orser; Michael Weiss; Denise Biellmann; and Surya Bonaly. Each will draw for a starting position one hour before the event. Then they will draw a style of music either classical jazz easy-listening rock n' roll theatrical and country.    The skaters then get one hour to listen to the music with 30 minutes allowed for on-ice rehearsal.    ``We have a group of people that some people would not expect the type of spontaneity we hope they will show'' Cousins said. ``I know they all have this ability.    ``There were skaters I thought of and we have most of the skaters there. They'll all be responsive such as Philippe Candeloro who is wonderfully spontaneous. And musically we are not going into the deepest realm of obscurity. It is music a lot of them will know.''    But they won't have skated to it at least not competitively. And they won't have much time to come up with a program that fits whether it be Tchaikovsky or Aerosmith or Brooks and Dunn.    ``There is nothing unskateable'' said Cousins who also will serve as artistic director for Improv-Ice which will be televised live by USA Network. ``I didn't pick the music until I knew the 12 skaters. I expect all of them be able to pull something together for whatever music they get.''    The audience also won't know the music a skater selected until the competition begins and the skater announces it.    Cousins is convinced the public needs to see something fresh from televised skating events. This approach certainly is fresh.    ``One of the things I found I like when creating these shows is doing things that have never been done before'' he said. ``People won't be seeing the same skaters doing the same material.    ``One thing I said to the agents was in no way would I intend to humiliate their clients. I think it is just a starting point with this.''
