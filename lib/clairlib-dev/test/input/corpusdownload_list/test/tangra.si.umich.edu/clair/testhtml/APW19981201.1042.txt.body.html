<HTML>    YAOUNDE Cameroon AP  Customs inspectors at Cameroon's main international airport seized 11 elephant tusks from two Chinese businessmen the chief customs officer said Tuesday.    The ivory tusks were discovered in the bags of the two men who were detained briefly and then permitted to travel onward from Cameroon's main commercial hub of Douala to Paris on Tuesday.    There is a worldwide ban on the sale and export of ivory although penalties for violators vary significantly from country to country.    In an unrelated incident a Nigerian man was arrested and charged with drug smuggling after he was found with sealed capsules of heroin in his stomach.    The heroin worth several thousand dollars was destined for Nigeria said Chief Customs Inspector Joseph Moulela.    The Nigerian John Chukwudi Amobi could face up to 10 years in jail if convicted in a Cameroonian court on drug smuggling charges.    Douala has become a transit point for drug shipments that ultimately head to Europe Douala International Airport Commandant Fabien Mballa Toulou.    In recent weeks concealed packages of heroin destined for Douala have been seized in the Pakistani port city of Karachi he said.    et/ids/tjs
