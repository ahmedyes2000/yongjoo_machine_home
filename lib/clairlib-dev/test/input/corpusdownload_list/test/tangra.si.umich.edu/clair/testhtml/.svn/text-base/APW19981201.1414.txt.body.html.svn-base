<HTML>    ARLINGTON Texas AP  Rafael Palmeiro is coming back to Texas.    The free agent first baseman and the Rangers agreed to a dlrs 45 million five-year contract on Tuesday five years after Texas signed Will Clark and let Palmeiro go to Baltimore.    Palmeiro who played for Texas from 1989-93 was a fan favorite in during his first stint in Arlington.    Palmeiro who had just finished his best season in Texas with a .295 average 37 homers and 105 RBIs flourished with the Orioles. He hit .296 this year with 43 homers and 121 RBIs leading Baltimore in homers hits 183 and RBIs.    His return to Texas gives the Rangers something they have sorely lacked  power from the left side of the plate. Palmeiro will be able to take advantage of the short left-field porch at The Ballpark.    Baltimore had been eager to bring Palmeiro back. The Orioles who signed Albert Belle to a dlrs 65 million five-year contract Tuesday also have lost Roberto Alomar Eric Davis and Alan Mills to free agency.
