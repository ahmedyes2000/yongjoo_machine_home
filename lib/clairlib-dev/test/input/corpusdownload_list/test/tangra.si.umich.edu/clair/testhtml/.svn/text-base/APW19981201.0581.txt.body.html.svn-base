<HTML>    LONDON AP  Nick Faldo is back in the tabloid headlines  not for his golf but his private life.    The Sun ran a front-page story Tuesday saying Faldo a three-time winner of both the British Open and Masters has a new girlfriend.    The woman was identified as 25-year-old Swiss public relations executive Valerie Bercher.    ``Faldo's Swiss Miss'' was The Sun's headline.    The paper said the two met at a recent tournament in Switzerland.    ``We have been a couple for the past few weeks'' The Sun quoted Bercher as saying. ``It's just the beginning but we are very happy together.''    ``Nick has a bad reputation for being a very cold man'' she added. ``But I have found this to be completely untrue.    The story came out just weeks after Faldo announced his breakup with American girlfriend Brenna Cepelak.    Faldo 41 was divorced in October from his second wife Gill. They had been married 12 years.    The Sun reported that Cepalak 23 smashed Faldo's Porsche with a golf club when he broke up with her in October causing 10000 pounds dlrs 16500 in damage.    Faldo mired in a deep slump had one of his few recent successes when he played on England's winning team in the World Cup of Golf last month in New Zealand.    scw
