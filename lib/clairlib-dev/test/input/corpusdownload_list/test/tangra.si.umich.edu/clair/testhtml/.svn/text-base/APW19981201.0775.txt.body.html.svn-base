<HTML>    SARAJEVO Bosnia-Herzegovina AP  A shipment of nine million newly minted coins reached Bosnia Tuesday to replace chewing gum and chocolate bars as the country's loose change.    The coins hot from London's Royal Mint are the first to reach Bosnia since the summer when the country introduced a new currency theKonvertibilna Marka. The currency valued at one German Mark dlrs 0.63 was issued only in bank notes until now.    Due to the lack of coinage Bosnian shops use chewing gum as ersatz 10 Fencing coins and small chocolate bars to replace coins of 20 Fineness. There are 100 Fineness to theMarka    ``We will waste no time in putting the coins into circulation ... so that people can feel them jingling in their pockets'' said Peter Nickel the governor of Bosnia's Central Bank. ``A sound that symbolizes a solid future built on a sound currency.''    The first coin shipment totals 936000 Konvertibilna Marka.    The 10 20 and 50 Fening coins are to be put into general circulation in December.    While shops had given chewing gum and chocolate bars as small change they refused to accept them as payment for goods. Many customers are left with large candy stashes.    Bosnia's market used four different currencies up until this summer when the Kovertibilna Marka was launched. The Bosnian Serbs used the Yugoslav Dinar the Bosnian Croats the Croatian Kuna and the central Muslim-dominated parts their own money. The German Mark remains accepted everywhere.    acr/amb/gj
