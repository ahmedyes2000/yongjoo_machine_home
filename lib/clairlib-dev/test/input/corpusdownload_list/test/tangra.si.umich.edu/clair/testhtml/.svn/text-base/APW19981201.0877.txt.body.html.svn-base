<HTML>    STOCKHOLM Sweden AP  Despite progress in integrating ethnic Russians and other minorities in the Baltics the Kremlin still considers the work insufficient Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Tuesday.    Ivanov said he will take up the issue in detail at the meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that begins Wednesday in Oslo Norway.    Kremlin complaints about the threatment of ethnic Russians in Latvia and Estonia where many of them have been without citizenship since the collapse of the Soviet Union has long been an irritant in the countries' relations and Russia this spring threatened trade sanctions against Latvia over the issue.    The OSCE has pushed Estonia and Latvia to improve the groups' standing. In October Latvian voters approved new laws removing some of the obstacles to ethnic Russians seeking naturalization.    ''We consider that certain steps have been taken to fulfill the OSCE's recommendations but they are not enough'' Ivanov said at a news conference after meeting with Prime Minister Goeran Persson and Foreign Minister Anna Lindh.    Russia believes that in the Baltics ''one should apply exactly the same standard of rights as in the rest of Europe -- not more not less'' Ivanov said.    Ivanov also said he presented figures to Persson and Lindh showing that Russia is following up on the promise that President Boris Yeltsin made a year ago in Stockholm to reduce its military strength in the northwest by about 40 percent.    jh
