<HTML>    BUCHAREST Romania AP  A former head of Romanian intelligence on Tuesday said Iraq expressed interest in Romania's missile technology three years ago but bilateral talks were inconclusive and did not result in sales to Baghdad.    Reacting to media reports that Romania provided Iraq with missile components Virgil Magureanu who headed the Romanian Information Service between 1990 and 1997 said the two countries held talks in 1995.    ``I don't know how far the negotiations went but they were stopped'' after the United States asked Romania to end them he told the Mediafax news agency. No weapons were sold he reportedly said.    Earlier Foreign Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Carmen Podgoreanu denied media reports that diplomats had confirmed Iraq-Romania missile talks. Other government officials refused comment.    mc/gj
