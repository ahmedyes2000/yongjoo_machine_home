<HTML>    KUWAIT AP  Former President Bush arrived Tuesday in Kuwait to meet with Kuwaiti dignitaries and U.S. troops maintaining weapons positioned here to defend against any Iraqi attack.    It was his third visit to a country that idolizes him as the hero of the 1991 Gulf War which ended a seven-month Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.    Although Bush's visit is a private one he was greeted at the airport by the crown prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah.    The former president planned to meet with U.S. Army troops stationed at Camp Doha north of Kuwait City.    Bush accompanied by a group of investors is to meet the emir Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah and attend a dinner with Kuwaiti dignitaries and businessmen. He was scheduled to leave early Wednesday.    Security is tight and the press has been told it will have no access to Bush during the visit.    When he first came to Kuwait in April 1993 authorities uncovered a plot to assassinate him. Two Iraqis were sentenced to death in connection with the plot and several others were given prison terms.    Bush earlier visited Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
