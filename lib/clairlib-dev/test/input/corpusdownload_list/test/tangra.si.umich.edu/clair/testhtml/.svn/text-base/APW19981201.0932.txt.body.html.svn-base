<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  With Russia's leaders urgently seeking financial help International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus began two days of talks in Moscow today on Russia's frozen loan agreement with the IMF.    Camdessus met with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov today and was scheduled to hold broader talks with government officials Wednesday.    ``I want to get better acquainted with the prime minister'' Camdessus told reporters. ``I presume we will be having interesting conversations.''    President Boris Yeltsin who is in a hospital being treated for pneumonia spoke with Primakov by telephone today about the talks with Camdessus.    In the Netherlands meanwhile former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin sought to reassure international investors that Russia would survive its economic problems.    He told an international business conference that his country's economic woes were ``far from desperate'' adding: ``European companies are still with us. They are not leaving Russia.''    Russia is seeking further installments on an IMF bailout package that was reached in the summer but was held up after the government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August. The IMF has said Russia must come up with a realistic recovery plan before more money will be released.    Camdessus is not expected to announce any breakthroughs but his visit gives Russia an opportunity to make its case and lobby for fresh funds.    The bailout package totals 22.6 billion and also involves the World Bank and the Japanese government but Russia has so far received only about 5 billion.    An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer subsidies to ailing industries.    If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon it will probably have to start printing money which would drive up inflation.    ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid hyperinflation'' Oleg Sysuyev a top presidential aide was quoted as saying today by the Interfax news agency.    The government has been delaying a debate on next year's budget as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet its expenses. The Cabinet again delayed the discussion this week but insisted the delay was not connected with Camdessus' visit.    However the Russian media claimed the government put off action on the budget because it is still hoping for the IMF loans.    ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague and their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit'' the business daily Kommersant said today.    Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko who was on a trip to the United States this week said Russia wouldn't be able to pay 17.5 billion in foreign debt that comes due next year.    ``The IMF must realize that and accept compromises with Russia in reaching agreements on restructuring foreign debts'' Kiriyenko said at New York University on Monday according to the Interfax news agency.
