<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus has returned to a Russia that badly wants aid to pay off mounting debts but has been unwilling to make the tough financial decisions required to win IMF cash.    Camdessus is scheduled to hold broad meetings in Moscow on Wednesday with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and other top Russian officials. The IMF chief met with Primakov after his arrival Tuesday night.    ``I want to get better acquainted with the prime minister'' Camdessus told reporters. ``I presume we will be having interesting conversations.''    The stakes are high: Russia owes billions of dollars to workers pensioners and foreign creditors and wants the IMF to release a frozen dlrs 22.6 billion bailout loan.    But Camdessus' visit is unlikely to produce any breakthroughs for this cash-starved country.    The IMF put the loan on hold after Russia's government succumbing to the economic crisis that began in Asia devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August. The fund is demanding that Russia come up with a realistic economic recovery plan before it will free up the loan.    Russia however has been waiting for the IMF to make the first move. The government delayed a debate this week on next year's budget as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet expenses.    While the Cabinet insisted the delay was not connected with Camdessus' visit Russian media have suggested the government put off action on the budget because it is still hoping for the IMF loans. The latest budget draft assumes Russia will receive the IMF money.    ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague and their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit'' the business daily Kommersant said Tuesday.    If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon it will probably have to start printing money which would drive up inflation and further imperil Russia's fragile economy.    ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid hyperinflation'' Oleg Sysuyev a top presidential aide told a news conference Tuesday.    An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer subsidies to ailing industries.    Russia has so far received only about dlrs 5 billion of the bailout package which also involves the World Bank and the Japanese government.    Sysuyev meanwhile reiterated that President Boris Yeltsin will leave day-to-day management of economic matters to Primakov. Yeltsin is in the hospital receiving treatment for pneumonia and will not meet with Camdessus.
