<HTML>    LONDON AP  Tennis one of three Olympic sports which dissented from an international agreement to unify anti-drug policies says it expects to fall into line before February's world summit on doping.    The International Tennis Federation joined the governing bodies of soccer FIFA and cycling UCI in expressing reservations to a package of anti-doping measures adopted Friday at a meeting of 35 Olympic sports federations.    The ITF said Tuesday that its leaders still need to consult with the men's ATP and women's WTA tours on the Olympic initiatives.    ``There is no other sport in the world that has the cohesive anti-doping program that tennis has'' ITF president Brian Tobin said. ``By the IOC conference in February we will have had the opportunity to discuss these issues with our partners and expect to be in a position to fully support the unified approach that the IOC has presented.''    During Friday's meeting in Lausanne Switzerland federations endorsed a minimum two-year suspension for athletes found guilty of using steroids or other serious banned drugs. The penalty for a second offense would be a life ban.    Under the terms of the agreement federations which don't fully comply with the measures risk being dropped from the Olympics.    IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has expressed confidence that tennis soccer and cycling will endorse the package before the Feb. 2-4 world anti-doping summit in Lausanne.    Tobin met with Samaranch at the ATP Tour World Championship finals in Hanover Germany last weekend.    The ITF said they discussed raising the profile of tennis at the Olympics ensuring that the world's top players take part and the possibility of having Olympic results count toward computer rankings on the men's tour.    ``The Olympic tennis event is a priority for the ITF and its aim is to continue to raise the profile of the event in association with the ATP Tour and WTA Tour'' the statement said.    Tennis was reinstated as a full Olympic sport at the 1988 Seoul Olympics after last appearing as a medal event in 1924. Some of the sport's top millionaire professionals have skipped the Olympics preferring to concentrate on the Grand Slams and tour events.    In a separate development the ITF said it was making significant progress in reunifying the separate bodies which govern the sport.    The ITF said it was working closely with the ATP Tour on joint marketing and promotional programs and collaborating on calendar issues to avoid scheduling conflicts involving tour events Grand Slams Davis Cup and Olympics.    sw
