<HTML>    PARIS AP  French train travelers faced another day of widespread disruptions after rail workers voted Tuesday to extend their five-day-old strike.    Unions voted to continue the walkout in 18 of 23 regions sparing only Brittany and parts of northern France. The state-run train company the SNCF said an average of one in three trains would run on Wednesday.    According to the SUD-Rail union 70 to 80 percent of the country's ticket inspectors are continuing to strike.    The Eurostar train to London however will remain unaffected by the walkout as will the Thalys train from Paris to Brussels Amsterdam and Cologne.    Rail workers in particular ticket inspectors are protesting what they see as insufficient staff. They are also concerned about how the government will implement a plan to cut the workweek from 39 to 35 hours.    The ticket inspectors have complained that a lack of employees has created a safety problem for workers and travelers.    The SNCF said Tuesday it would hold a national meeting Dec. 7 and 8 to address train workers' concerns.    parf-sp
