<HTML>    DIYARBAKIR Turkey AP  An explosion here Tuesday on a busy shopping street killed a young woman officials suspected was a Kurdish suicide bomber the Turkish news agency Anatolia reported.    At least nine people were injured in the blast in the town of Lice in southeastern Turkey the heart of the 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy.    The cause of the blast was not known but Anatolia said officials suspected a suicide bombing by Kurdish rebels.    The dead person was in her late teens the report said. Female militants have in the past carried out suicide bomb attacks in southeast with explosives strapped to their waists. Last month a Kurdish woman died setting off a bomb last month near a military garrison that wounded two others.    The blast could discredit claims by rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan who was detained in Rome last month that the group is renouncing violence in the struggle for autonomy for Kurds.    Close to 37000 people have been killed since Ocalan's group began fighting in 1984.    sf-fd
