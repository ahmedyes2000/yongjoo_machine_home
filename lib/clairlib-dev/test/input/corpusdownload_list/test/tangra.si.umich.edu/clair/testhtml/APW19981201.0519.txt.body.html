<HTML>    CAIRO Egypt AP  A Libyan plane flew to Chad on Tuesday apparently violating U.N. sanctions that ban flights to and from the North African nation Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.    The plane was carrying a delegation from the Libyan General People's Congress which serves as the country's legislature to the Chadian capital of N'Djamena MENA said in a dispatch from the Libyan capital Tripoli.    It said the Libyans would participate in the 6th anniversary celebration of Chad's revolution.    The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions in 1992 including a flight ban to try to force Libya hand over two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie Scotland that killed 270 people.    African countries voted in June to ignore the flight ban. Since then a number of African leaders have flown to Libya.    The latest was Djibouti's president Hassan Gouled Aptidon who arrived in Libya on Monday.    Libya from time to time has sent jets out of the country especially for official visits to African nations. It also has sent planes to Saudi Arabia carrying Libyan pilgrims to the annual hajj.
