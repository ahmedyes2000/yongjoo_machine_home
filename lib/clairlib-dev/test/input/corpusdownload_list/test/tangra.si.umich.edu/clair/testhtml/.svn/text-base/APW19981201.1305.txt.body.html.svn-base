<HTML>    ROCKVILLE Maryland AP  Mike Tyson pleaded no contest on Tuesday to charges he assaulted two men following a traffic accident.    Although the plea is not an admission of guilt Tyson faces up to 20 years in prison  10 years on each count  when he is sentenced early next year.    ``He admits to losing his temper on the side of the road'' Tyson attorney Paul Kemp said.    Tyson told Judge Steven Johnson he was not promised leniency and does not expect preferential treatment in sentencing. He also said he was aware his plea could affect his probation for a 1992 rape conviction in Indiana.    ``The state was prepared to present the facts in the case'' said Assistant State's Attorney Carol Crawford objecting to Johnson acceptance of the plea.    The charges stem from an Aug. 31 accident involving his wife Monica in Montgomery County in suburban Washington D.C.    Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick said Tyson kicked and punched them following the accident. They have reached an out-of-court settlement with Tyson to avoid a civil suit in the case.    ``The complainants will testify at sentencing that this is the appropriate plea'' Kemp said.    Outside court Tyson would not discuss the incident although he did talk about a Jan. 16 bout against Francois Botha. The Nevada Athletic Commission returned Tyson's boxing license in October. It was revoked after he bit champion Evander Holyfield's ears during a June 1997 title bout.
