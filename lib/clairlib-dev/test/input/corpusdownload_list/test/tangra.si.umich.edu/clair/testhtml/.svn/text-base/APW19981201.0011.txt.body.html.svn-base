<HTML>    SINGAPORE AP  Asia's first sextuplets astonished their Indonesian parents and Singapore doctors who expected five babies instead of six a newspaper reported Tuesday.    One girl and five boys were delivered by Caesarean section during a one-hour operation at Singapore's Gleneagles Hospital on Friday.    ``I was stunned and overjoyed when the nurse ran out of the operation theater and told me I had not five but six babies'' Indonesian businessman Andre Prijono 30 was quoted as saying Monday by The Straits Times.    Prijono and his wife 26-year-old Susan Tjokrosetio underwent fertility treatment in March. Nature caught up with the first-time parents in November.    Daughter Deidree was delivered first followed by brothers Danny Davis Dylon and Douglas. The doctor only discovered Dominick as he prepared for a post-delivery procedure.    ``I was about to remove the unusually heavy placenta when hello I saw a baby's knee among the membranes'' fertility expert Dr. Christopher Chen was quoted as saying.    Five fetuses had appeared during ultrasound scans said Chen who added that the hospital had only prepared a corresponding number of incubators and doctors to care for each child.    ``We hoped for one pregnancy but we ended up with six'' said Chen. ``I had not known that both parents had family records of multiple pregnancies.''    The babies weighed between 1.26 and 1.82 kilograms 2.77 and 4.00 pounds at birth and were carried by their mother for a record 33 weeks said the report.    ``The nurses say my wife's a superwoman but we aren't planning any more children for the moment'' said Prijono on Monday.
