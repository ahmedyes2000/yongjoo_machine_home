Two million of the 3-markkaa 58-cent stamp will be issued on January 15 said Markku Penttinen from the post office's philatelic center.    Foreign philatelists and racing fans had inquired if the post office would issue a Hakkinen stamp if he won the championship Penttinen said.    ``We believed in his victory'' Penttinen said. ``And we began planning the stamp before the crucial race'' in Japan on Nov. 1 he said.    The stamp shows a smiling Hakkinen in silver overalls holding his arms up in a demonstration of victory.    Previously the Finnish Post Office has issued stamps of leading sports figures including world rally champions Timo Makinen and Juha Kankkunen.    mhh-jh
