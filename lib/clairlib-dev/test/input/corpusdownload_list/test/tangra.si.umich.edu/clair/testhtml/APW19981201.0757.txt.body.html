<HTML>    STOCKHOLM Sweden AP  Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will travel this weekend to the capitals of Sweden and Norway both countries that have played roles in the Middle East peace process.    On Saturday Arafat is to take part in a Middle East conference in Stockholm called to mark the 10th anniversary of Arafat's statement in the Swedish capital that the Palestine Liberation Organization recognized Israel's right to exist.    Representatives from Israel and the United States have also been invited to Stockholm for the meeting but they did not say who would attend.    ``We are not counting on representatives coming from the United States and Israel on such a high level as Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Madeleine Albright'' the U.S. Secretary of State Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh said Tuesday.    Whatever the representation ``we can at least have a good and profitable discussion'' Lindh said.    On Sunday Arafat is to make a stopover in Oslo Norway said Norwegian foreign ministry spokesman Ingvard Havnen. Arafat was invited by Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek.    Although the Oslo stopped is planned to last only a few hours any trip by Palestinian or Israeli officials to the Norwegian capital has symbolic weight because the Israel-PLO peace accord was worked out in secret negotiations in Norway that became known as the ``Oslo Channel.''    The peace process has often stalled since Netanyahu became prime minister.    The process appeared to move forward last week after Israel began the first stage of its agreed withdrawl from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January. In exchange Palestinians agreed to take measures against Islamic militants.    But new acrimony arose this week when Netanyahu said he would walk away from the peace agreements if Arafat unilaterally declares Palestinian statehood in May. The Palestinians contend the peace agreements do not prevent such a declaration after the end of a five-year period of autonomy.    The Palestinians also contend that Israel has breached an agreement to release 750 prisoners. In the first stage of the release most of the 250 set free were criminals; the Palestinians demand that Israel free political activists and those jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
