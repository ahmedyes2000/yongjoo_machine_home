<HTML>    ROCKVILLE Maryland AP  Mike Tyson pleaded no contest Tuesday to misdemeanor assault a decision that could return the former heavyweight champion to prison.    Although the plea to the two counts is not an admission of guilt Tyson faces up to 20 years in prison  10 years on each count  when he is sentenced early next year by a Maryland judge. He also could be fined up to dlrs 2500 on each count.    The charges stem from an Aug. 31 traffic accident in Montgomery County Md. involving Tyson's wife Monica. Tyson was accused of kicking and punching two motorists after the accident.    ``You understand that this plea could affect your parole'' Judge Steven Johnson told Tyson before accepting his plea.    ``I'm truly aware of that'' said Tyson who was released from prison in 1995 after serving three years of six-year sentence for a 1992 rape conviction in Indiana.    Tyson who is scheduled to fight Francois Botha on Jan. 16 would not discuss his case outside court.    It will be up to Indiana authorities to decide whether the no-contest pleas violated his probation.    By late Tuesday afternoon Marion County Indiana Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford had not heard from probation officials about Tyson her clerk Becky Wagner said. She said probation officials would decide whether to request a violation hearing for Tyson.    George Walker chief probation officer for Marion County was out of the office until Wednesday.    Tyson told Johnson he did not expect leniency or a lighter sentence in return for entering the no-contest pleas.    The prosecutor urged that jail time be included in the punishment.    ``The state opposes any probation before judgment'' said Assistant State's Attorney Carol Crawford.    Tyson's lawyer Paul Kemp said the plea was an appropriate resolution to the case.    ``Mr. Tyson certainly concedes that things occurred that were inappropriate'' Kemp said.    Following the August accident Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick said Tyson attacked them. They have reached a settlement with Tyson to avoid a civil suit.    Kemp said Saucedo and Hardick are prepared to testify at sentencing that they support Tyson's no-contest plea.    ``He does not admit to intentionally striking anyone when this incident occurred'' Kemp said.    Kemp told the judge that Tyson became angry when neither Hardick nor Saucedo expressed concern for his wife who was driving when the accident occurred.    Kemp admitted that Hardick was struck with a glancing blow and Saucedo was inadvertently kicked as the boxer was restrained by his wife and bodyguard.    Tyson is undergoing psychiatric treatment one of the conditions that led to reinstatement of his boxing license by the Nevada Athletic Commission in October. The license was revoked after he bit champion Evander Holyfield's ears during a June 1997 title bout.
