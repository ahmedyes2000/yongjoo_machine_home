<HTML>    LONDON AP  Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet left a north London psychiatric hospital Tuesday evening driven away to an undisclosed destination in an ambulance in a covoy headed by police vehicles.    To chants of ``We want justice'' from demonstrators some shaking their fists the ambulance swept through the gates of Grovelands Priory a day after the hospital announced that the 83-year-old general did not need medical care and demanded that he leave.    The move by the hospital where Pinochet has been since Oct. 29 dealt a blow to any plan he had to plead he is too ill to be extradited to Spain to stand trial on charges of genocide and torture.    Chilean diplomatic cars followed the ambulance into the night with armed police in a vehicle at the rear.    There was no immediate word on where Pinochet was headed. Supporters have been looking for a house where he can wait in comfort to learn whether the British government will agree to extradition.    There was speculation he would head to a nine-bedroom home on a luxurious estate in Surrey near the Wentworth Golf Club home of the European golf tour about 20 miles 30 kms west of central London.    If Home Secretary Jack Straw who must rule by Dec. 11 allows extradition proceedings to begin Pinochet will likely be in Britain for months fighting his case through the courts.    Wherever he stays his neighbors face disruption. Chilean exiles mount demonstrations and there is a police guard and heavy police presence.    Earlier his lawyer said Pinochet was distressed by the hospital's demand for him to leave. He had planned to move on Monday but the arrangement fell through because of ``unforeseen practical difficulties'' said lawyer Michael Caplan.    Adding to Pinochet's troubles an opinion poll published Tuesday indicated that a narrow majority  51 percent  of Britons think Pinochet should be extradited.    The National Opinion poll published in London's Evening Standard said 32 percent of a 961-strong sample of voters questioned nationwide wanted him sent home and the rest had no opinion. The error margin was plus or minus three percent.    A Chilean government report says some 3000 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's 1970-93 rule.    But Chile is trying to get him back because of fears that the anger of his supporters may destabilize its democracy.    Chile's foreign minister Jose Miguel Insulza was in Spain Tuesday after lobbying British officials arguing that Pinochet may be tried in Chile if he is freed.    mj
