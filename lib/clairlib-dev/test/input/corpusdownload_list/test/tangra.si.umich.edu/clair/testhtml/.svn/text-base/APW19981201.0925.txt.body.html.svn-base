<HTML>    NEWCASTLE England AP  The two former Newcastle United directors who stepped down in disgrace after making disparaging remarks about the club's supporters and the city's women are seeking to be reinstated.    Douglas Hall and Freddy Shepherd launched a bid Tuesday to return to the company board of the Premier League club.    Hall and Shepherd left the board last season after being caught on film mocking Newcastle fans for paying high prices for club merchandise describing Newcastle women as ``dogs'' and calling star striker Alan Shearer ``Mary Poppins.''    Hall's Cameron Hall Developments which owns 57 percent of the club has proposed that the two former bosses be brought back.    The pair want to replace their representatives on the board John Fender and Tom Fenton.    While the move will go before a vote of shareholders Hall's holding combined with the 8.1 percent owned by a trust run by Shepherd means the pair can easily vote themselves back onto the board.    Chairman Dennis Cassidy delayed the company's Annual General Meeting to give remaining shareholders a chance to consider the plan. The meeting was originally scheduled for next Monday.    The two were reinstated to the soccer club board in July but not to the main company board.    sw
