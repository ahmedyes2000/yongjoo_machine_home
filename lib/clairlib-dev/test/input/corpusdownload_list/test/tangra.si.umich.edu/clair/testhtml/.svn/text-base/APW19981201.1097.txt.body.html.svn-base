<HTML>    PHOENIX AP  Olympic champion Gary Hall was cleared Tuesday to swim in a World Cup meet despite a marijuana-related suspension scheduled to run through Dec. 12.    U.S. federal court Judge Roger Strand who issued a temporary restraining order Monday allowing Hall to compete upheld by his earlier ruling.    FINA swimming's world governing body contended Hall's appeal should be dismissed and the rest of his suspension upheld. The organization said the court should have no jurisdiction in the case.    FINA secretary Gunnar Werner said the federation would not appeal.    ``We can do nothing more other than obey the order'' he said Tuesday by phone from Sweden.    ``This decision is only valid in the United States'' he added. ``Hall is still suspended in the rest of the world.''    Hall's appeal against FINA's three-month suspension still has to be heard in full by the Court of Arbitration of Sport in Switzerland.    ``Our position is that FINA rules are prevailing in a case like this'' Werner said. ``Our position is the court in the U.S. is not competent.''    Werner said an appeal would take too long. He added that the case underscores the ongoing battle between international sports federations and the courts especially in the United States.    ``Our position is that FINA rules should prevail all around the world'' he said. ``But what can we do if a national court makes a ruling? We can only fight for our position.''    Hall who lives in Phoenix won gold medals as part of the U.S. 400-meter freestyle and 400 medley relay teams in the 1996 Atlanta Games. He also won silver medals in the 50 and 100 freestyle.    He was scheduled to compete in Tuesday's World Cup meet and later this week in the U.S. Open meet both in College Station Texas.    His lawyers argued that both competitions are essential to Hall's bid to compete in the 2000 Olympics and secure endorsements.    Hall was temporarily suspended in July after FINA said he tested positive for marijuana during a May 15 competition in Phoenix. That prevented Hall from swimming in the Goodwill Games and the U.S. Senior Nationals.    The federation delayed the suspension in August to allow a hearing after Hall appealed.    During a Nov. 6 hearing Hall received his three-month suspension from FINA's doping panel for testing positive for marijuana. That suspension was effective Nov. 12.    FINA then deducted two of the three months already served by Hall during the temporary suspension which left him with 30 more days to serve.
