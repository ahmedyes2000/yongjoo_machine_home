<HTML>    NYERI Kenya AP  Kenya and Ethiopia Tuesday pledged to monitor and maintain law and order along their common border where a recent attack on herders left at least 140 people dead.    The pledge was contained in a joint statement issued at the end of a three-day meeting in Kenya's Eastern Province on deteriorating security in the area.    Early last month armed men from southern Ethiopia attacked nomads at a watering hole in northeastern Kenya killing 140 people kidnapping another 52 and making off with 17500 cattle and camels.    Survivors  ethnic Somalis living in Kenya for generations  said many of the attackers were well-armed members of the Oromo tribe from southern Ethiopia.    The Oromo Liberation Front which seeks independence from Ethiopia for much of southern Ethiopia crosses back and forth into Kenya.    The joint statement said a regular exchange of information about activities along the border was necessary to increase security.    Northeastern Province Commissioner Maurice Makhanu who headed the Kenyan delegation called for an all-out effort to enhance peace and security in the area.    The 18-man Ethiopian delegation was headed by Federal Police Commissioner Maj. Alemseged G. Yohannes.    The talks centered on border security and cooperation between the two countries including illegal movement of people trafficking of arms across the border revival of radio communication between the two security sides and cooperation on anti-terrorism. Other areas covered were immigration refugee matters and border inspection and maintenance.    The delegates suggested that meetings be held twice a year and fixed the next for April in Bahr-Dar Ethiopia.    jb/sl
