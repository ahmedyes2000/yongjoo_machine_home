<HTML>    BANGKOK Thailand AP  Thailand's cash-strapped government has cut year-end bonuses for executives of state enterprises but spared rank and file workers because of concerns about a possible backlash.    State enterprise workers organizations had threatened retaliation against the government if bonuses were cut for regular workers according to Wednesday's Bangkok Post.    In Thailand many workers count on a large year-end bonus totaling several months pay to make up for low monthly salaries.    During the last two years violence erupted at some private companies when they told workers their bonuses would be reduced because of a bad business year.    An announcement from the Cabinet on Wednesday said executives of state enterprises must have their bonuses for 1999 reduced by at least 30 percent.    The rule will also apply to non-state enterprises in which the government or state enterprises hold more than a 50 percent stake.    State enterprise workers recently staged a protest in front of parliament angry and fearful over austerity and privatization plans they argue are being forced on the government by the International Monetary Fund as part of its bailout of the Thai economy.    Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in modern times and is receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion rescue package from the IMF.    The IMF has required Thailand to undertake economic reforms that include privatizing state enterprises which are generally viewed as inefficient.    The government has countered state enterprise workers' claims by saying that privatization is not being forced upon by the IMF but is being done to make the economy more competitive.
