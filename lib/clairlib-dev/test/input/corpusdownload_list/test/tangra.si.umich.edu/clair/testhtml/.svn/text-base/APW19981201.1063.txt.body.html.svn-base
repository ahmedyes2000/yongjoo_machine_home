<HTML>    TORONTO AP  Vancouver and the nearby ski resort of Whistler have been chosen as Canada's candidate to bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics the Canadian Olympic Association announced Tuesday.    Voting by 72 delegates actually took place Nov. 21 in a three-way race involving Vancouver-Whistler Quebec City and Calgary Alberta host of the 1988 Winter Games.    But the Olympic association delayed announcing the results until a day after Monday's provincial election in Quebec. There was unspoken concern that rejection of Quebec City's bid might trigger a backlash among voters choosing between separatist and anti-separatist parties.    Vancouver-Whistler led the first ballot with 26 votes one ahead of Quebec City. Calgary dropped off the ballot after getting 21 votes.    The Vancouver bid took the second ballot 40-31.    Vancouver-Whistler was considered the front-runner because many Canadian Olympic officials believed it had the best chance of winning the 2010 bid.    Toronto meanwhile is bidding for 2008 Summer Olympics.    A successful Toronto bid would deal a death blow to Vancouver-Whistler's chances because it is considered very unlikely Canada would be selected or want to host consecutive Olympics. Beijing is now considered the 2008 frontrunner.    The International Olympic Committee will choose the 2010 host city in 2003.
