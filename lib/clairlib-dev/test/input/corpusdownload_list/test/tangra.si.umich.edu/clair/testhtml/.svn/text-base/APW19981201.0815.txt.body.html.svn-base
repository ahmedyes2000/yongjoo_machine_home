<HTML>    LONDON AP  Britain prepared a frosty reception Tuesday for visiting Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe  angered by new moves to seize white-owned farms intervention in the Congo's civil war a ban on strikes and his flying to Libya in defiance of a U.N. embargo.    Although Mugabe's visit was billed as private Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd had asked to see him officials said.    Mugabe increasingly unpopular in his central African nation was due in London later Tuesday from Paris where he attended a French-African summit after visiting Libya and Egypt. There was no official word on his arrival and the Zimbabwe High Commission or embassy did not return calls.    ``There is quite a list of things we would like to raise'' said a Foreign Office spokeswoman speaking on customary condition of anonymity. ``We are still waiting confirmation of when the meeting will take place.''    Britain has said it is concerned that the Zimbabwe government's latest plan to acquire compulsorily 841 farms owned by members of the former central African colony's tiny white minority ran counter to a pledge in September to hold off on poorly planned confiscations.    Aid donors and international aid organizations are concerned about disruption of productivity.    Zimbabwe also has been harshly criticized internationally for a land redistribution program marked by delays mismanagement corruption and handing some seized properties to politicians.    Despite increasing economic hardship at home Mugabe has deployed at huge expense some 8000 troops to support Congolese President Laurent Kabila.    Mugabe visited Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Nov. 21 apparently flying directly to Tripoli in violation of a U.N. flight ban. It was imposed in 1992 to try to force Libya to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie Scotland.    African countries voted in June to ignore the ban.    London's Daily Mail newspaper demanded across its front-page that Britain arrest Mugabe on a litany on charges including genocide and tyranny.    The pro-conservative tabloid declared that Mugabe warranted the same fate as Gen. Augusto Pinochet the former Chilean dictator who is under arrest here on a Spanish warrant seeking his extradition to face charges of genocide and torture during his 1973-90 rule.    There would be no possibility of Mugabe being arrested  all serving heads of state have total immunity from prosecution under British law.    The newspaper however cited Mugabe 74 to illustrate what it claimed was ``diplomatic anarchy'' caused by a Nov. 25 ruling by Britain's highest court the House of Lords that as an ex-head of state Pinochet has no immunity from arrest.    The newspaper charged that Mugabe's troops killed up to 20000 members of the Ndebele ethnic minority after independence from Britain in 1980 and that he is guilty of corruption land theft and persecuting minorities by fierce verbal attacks on gays and lesbians and forcing Congo refugees to return home to almost certain death.    ``Both old men have a repellent record'' the Daily Mail said of Mugabe and Pinochet.    mj
