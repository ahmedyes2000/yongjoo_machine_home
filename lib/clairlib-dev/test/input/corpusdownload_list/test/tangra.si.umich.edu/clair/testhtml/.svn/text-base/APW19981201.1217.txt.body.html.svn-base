<HTML>    MEXICO CITY AP  Villagers returned to their homes on the slopes of the Colima volcano on Tuesday after a 15-day evacuation caused by bursts of ash and rivers of lava.    About 180 residents of the town of La Yerbabuena in western Colima state returned although soldiers planned to stay in the town to stand guard.    ``The danger posed by the volcano has diminished'' Colima civil protection official Javier Velasco said. ``People can return to their daily lifestyles and children can go back to school.''    But some experts advised continued caution. Geologist Michael Sheridan of the University of Buffalo in New York state said the Colima volcano could be entering a period of activity that he said comes every 40-50 years.    ``Colima is going through its regular cycle and it's approaching its climactic phase which is going to be very violent'' he said. ``It could happen this week or it could happen within a month.''    Meanwhile the Popocatepetl Volcano near Mexico City also showed signs of diminished activity the National Center for Disaster Prevention said.    The ``Popo'' as local residents call it had six brief bursts Tuesday morning sending small quantities of ash over nearby towns.    Soldiers have increased patrols to keep climbers and hikers at least 4 1/2 miles 7 kms away from the Popo's crater.    Although no evacuations have been ordered the Mexico City government reportedly is setting up more than 100 shelters capable of housing 53000 people in the event that they become necessary.
