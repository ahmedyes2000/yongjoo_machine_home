<HTML>    UNITED NATIONS AP  On World AIDS Day actress Sharon Stone urged parents to accept that they cannot stop their children from having sex  and to provide them with condoms so they don't become one of the 7000 young people infected with HIV every day.    ``No matter how much we guide our children within our families within our churches within our schools we are not stronger than the power of sexuality  particularly to a teenager'' she told a panel discussion on AIDS and youth Tuesday at the United Nations.    For the past three years Stone has been chairman of the American Foundation for AIDS Research's campaign for AIDS research. She arrived 40 minutes late for the panel discussion focusing on youth and AIDS with a good excuse.    ``I was at a very good party last night. I was at a party where we raised nearly dlrs 2 million for AIDS research'' she said as the audience burst into applause.    Stone 40 who became a star after her steamy role in ``Basic Instinct'' recalled how she never told her parents she was having sex in the back seat of a car as a teenager.    ``I do not encourage teenagers to have sex because it is painful and difficult enough just to be a teenager'' she said. ``But I can tell you that no matter how much someone encouraged me I lost my virginity while still a teenager and I would guess that most of you did too.''    Stone urged parents to tell their children about sex and she encouraged teenagers to talk to each other about sexuality  and about the danger of AIDS. She cited the latest statistics: 5.8 million new HIV infections in 1998 including 3 million young people aged 10 to 24.    Stone urged parents to accept the power of sex ``by allowing a safe nonjudgmental way for children to protect themselves.''    ``I believe that if you truly truly love your children you need to supply condoms in a place in your home at a quantity that makes it a nonjudgmental situation for them to have them. I mean put 200 condoms in a box in some place in the house where everybody isn't all the time so that your kids can take them'' she said.    ``If they want to make water balloons out of them great. If they want to carry them so they feel tough great. If they want to give them to their friends even better'' she said.    Stone said adults have a responsibility to ensure that young people have protection.    ``A lot of people say I can't give this teenager condoms their parents are going to lose their minds with me. I don't care. I will lose my friends before I will let their children die  and that is the choice you are looking at'' she said.    Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette noted that 95 percent of all infections and deaths are in the developing world and about half the new HIV infections now occur in people aged 15-24.    ``There is a vaccine for AIDS'' said Candido Gonzalez a senior member of the New York Citizens AIDS Network. ``It is called education.''    Gonzalez fought back tears as he described how he watched his mother two cousins an uncle and more than 60 friends die of AIDS.    ``I plead for world leaders to come together to put an end to this pandemic'' said Gonzalez who has lived with AIDS himself for the last 16 years.
