<HTML>    BORDEAUX France AP  American fugitive Ira Einhorn appeared in court Tuesday for a hearing to determine whether he'll be extradited to the United States for the brutal 1977 murder of his girlfriend. The court said it would rule on Jan. 12.    The 57-year-old fugitive was defiant as he again denied killing Helen ``Holly'' Maddux whose corpse was found in a trunk in his closet.    ``One thing'' Einhorn said pointing his finger at the judge. ``I did not kill Holly Maddux. C'est tout That's all.''    That was Einhorn's only statement and it left Maddux's siblings shaking their heads in disbelief.    ``It was a clear attempt to provoke some outburst from us'' said Elisabeth Hall the victim's sister. ``He's a pitiful character and knows exactly what he has done.''    Einhorn has been sentenced in absentia to life in prison by a Pennsylvania court for the murder.    A prominent anti-war campaigner and New Age activist in the 1960s Einhorn fled the United States shortly before he was due to be tried. But after 16 years in hiding he was tracked down and arrested at his French home in June 1997.    Einhorn looked relaxed during the two-hour hearing only occasionally glancing at the three sisters and brother of his alleged victim.    He entered the court building Tuesday holding hands with his companion Anika Flodin and refused to answer questions.    But the Ms. Hall was more outspoken.    ``We are here in France to remind the judges that underneath all this international law and political squabbling there is a person who was murdered and who looks like us'' Hall said.    ``Anybody can see there has been a definite undercurrent of anti-Americanism'' she said.    A French court refused to extradite Einhorn in December 1997 citing a French law that would have required a retrial if he was extradited. Pennsylvania then passed a law promising Einhorn a retrial. He was re-arrested in September.    His defense lawyers argue that if extradited Einhorn could face the death penalty which is banned under French law. They also claim Pennsylvania courts might withdraw the pledge of a retrial.    In a November interview on ABC television Einhorn declared his innocence and claimed the CIA or KGB framed him after he uncovered classified mind-control experiments.    When Maddux a former cheerleader from Tyler Texas disappeared Einhorn said she had gone shopping and never returned.    But 18 months later neighbors told police of a stench coming from Einhorn's apartment and Maddux's battered remains were found. Forensic experts said her skull had been smashed six times.    ip-jn-parf
