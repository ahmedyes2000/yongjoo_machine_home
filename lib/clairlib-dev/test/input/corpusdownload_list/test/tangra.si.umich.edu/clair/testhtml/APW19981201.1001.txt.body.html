<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  An aide to President Boris Yeltsin urged prosecutors Tuesday to investigate the Bolsheviks for carrying out the 1917 revolution  a move apparently intended to discourage their successors.    Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff Yevgeny Savostyanov spoke at a meeting of the presidential commission set up to fight political extremism.    The prosecutors should give a ``legal assessment of the Bolshevik action to seize power'' Savostyanov was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.    The statement reflected the government's concern about the increasing aggressiveness of the Communist Party which has the largest faction in the Russian parliament and enjoys broad nationwide support.    The Communists have also led a panel in parliament seeking to impeach Yeltsin  and among the charges they are investigating is his role in instigating the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union the Bolsheviks' creation.    In the latest embarrassment to the Kremlin the Communists recently won a sweeping victory in local elections in the southern Krasnodar region.    Krasnodar Gov. Nikolai Kondratenko a Communist has often indulged in anti-Semitic and anti-government rhetoric. Communist lawmaker Albert Makashov similarly sparked a recent uproar with his anti-Semitic remarks.    The Communist Party rebuked Makashov only grudgingly after strong pressure in Russia and abroad. Makashov enjoys legal immunity as a lawmaker and the government hasn't yet moved to persecute him.    Kondratenko meanwhile has been invited to the Justice Ministry for a ``conversation'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday.    The presidential panel on Tuesday discussed possible amendments to Russian laws to crack down on political extremism.
