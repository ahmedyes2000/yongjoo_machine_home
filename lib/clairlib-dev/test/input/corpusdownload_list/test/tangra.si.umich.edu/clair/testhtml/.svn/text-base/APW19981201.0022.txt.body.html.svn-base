<HTML>    SINGAPORE AP  Singapore already boasts a cyber bus equipped with computer equipment used to teach workers new skills.    Now buses are installing telephones so that commuters can keep in touch on the move.    Trans-Island Bus Service has placed a mobile phone on one of their coaches for a month-long trial and will outfit more buses if the response is good said The Straits Times on Tuesday.    During the trial use of the phones is free though calls will be limited to three minutes added the report.    In July the subway rail system installed two phones on one train for an initial six-month period.    Singapore's planners are constantly embracing the latest technologies and working to implement them into general use.    For their part many Singaporeans have a penchant for gadgets and high-tech devices. Mobile phones and palmtop computers are now so common that young teenagers are often seen toting the expensive status symbols.
