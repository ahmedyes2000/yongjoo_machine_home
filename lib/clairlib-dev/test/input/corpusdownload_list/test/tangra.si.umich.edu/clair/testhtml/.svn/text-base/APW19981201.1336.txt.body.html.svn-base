<HTML>    LONDON AP  Men who detest Christmas shopping have a new excuse to avoid the chore  it's hazardous to the their health.    Male stress levels skyrocket when they're confronted with facing crowded stores choosing gifts and standing in check-out lines a new British study shows.    ``The peak stress levels were equivalent to emergency situations experienced by fighter pilots or policemen going into dangerous situations'' said psychologist David Lewis who did the research.    The study commissioned by the Brent Cross Shopping Center in north London sent about three dozen men and women of different ages to stores with identical Christmas lists. Some went alone while others were accompanied by children.    An accompanying researcher recorded periodic blood pressure and heart rate figures during the trips. Further information regarding how survey participants were chosen and specific numbers of men and women involved were not immediately available.    Every man in the survey suffered considerable increases in blood pressure and heart rates while only one in four women registered a significant change.    ``For men even the thought of going shopping was enough to send stress levels soaring'' Lewis said. ``Over 70 percent of them recorded above-average readings before even stepping out the front door.''    Most men surveyed admitted that the stress of Christmas shopping would make them choose the first gift they see rather than spend time in crowded stores considering the options.    The type of store can have an effect on men too. Retailers playing loud music in a crowded atmosphere sent blood pressures soaring in two-thirds of the men.    ``Almost all the women who went shopping with their partners regretted the decision and surprisingly stress levels were considerably lower for those who shopped with children than those who took boyfriends or husbands'' Lewis said.    ms
