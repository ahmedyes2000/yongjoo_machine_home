<HTML>    MARJAYOUN Lebanon AP  Roadside explosions killed an Israeli-backed Lebanese militiaman and wounded another in south Lebanon on Tuesday security officials said.    The Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the two blasts near a road junction outside the town of Jezzine 20 kilometers 12 miles north of Israel's panhandle.    A fighter of the South Lebanon Army militia was wounded in the first blast at 2:30 a.m. 0030gmt and a colleague was killed in another explosion nine hours later said Lebanese security officials who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.    The attacks came amid mounting tension in Lebanon following Israeli threats to bomb the capital Beirut to avenge the deaths of Israeli soldiers. Seven Israelis have been killed by guerrillas in south Lebanon since mid-November.    Hezbollah's claim said the early morning blast ripped through a jeep traveling in a convoy of vehicles from the South Lebanon Army which is armed and financed by Israel.    The victim in the second explosion was a militia security official Jean Mukheiber who was killed as he walked away from a militia checkpoint the Lebanese officials said.    Hezbollah of the Party of God is leading a guerrilla battle to oust Israeli soldiers and their allied militiamen from an enclave that Israel has occupied in south Lebanon since 1985.    Israel claims the occupation is needed to protect its northern towns from attack but the frequent deaths of Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon has raised debate in Israel about maintaining the occupation.
