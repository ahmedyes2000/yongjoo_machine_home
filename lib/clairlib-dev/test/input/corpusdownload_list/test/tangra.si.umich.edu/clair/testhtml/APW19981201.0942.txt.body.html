<HTML>    SIDON Lebanon AP  Hezbollah guerrillas carried out four attacks against Israeli and allied militiamen in south Lebanon Tuesday killing one fighter security officials said.    The victim was a member of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army who was killed in an explosion outside the town of Jezzine said the officials.    Another explosion in Jezzine 20 kilometers 12 miles north of Israel's panhandle wounded another SLA militiaman said the officials speaking on customary condition of anonymity.    Guerrillas also targeted joint SLA-Israeli military positions in the Lebanese villages of Blatt and Sojod both about 500 meters yards north of the Israeli border. No casualties were reported said the Lebanese officials.    They confirmed the attacks were carried out by Hezbollah.    The Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah or Party of God said in statements its guerrillas targeted outposts belonging to SLA and Israeli troops in the central and western sectors of an Israeli-occupied enclave in South Lebanon.    The attacks came amid mounting tension in Lebanon following Israeli threats to bomb the capital Beirut to avenge the deaths of Israeli soldiers. Seven Israelis have been killed by guerrillas in south Lebanon since mid-November.    Hezbollah of the Party of God is leading a guerrilla battle to oust the SLA and Israeli soldiers from an enclave that Israel has occupied in south Lebanon since 1985.    Israel claims the occupation is needed to protect its northern towns from attack but the frequent deaths of Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon has raised debate in Israel about maintaining the occupation.
