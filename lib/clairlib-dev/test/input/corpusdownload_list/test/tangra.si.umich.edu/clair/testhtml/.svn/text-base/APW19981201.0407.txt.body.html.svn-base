<HTML>    TEHRAN Iran AP  Iran will test an electronic warfare system capable of jamming enemy radar in maneuvers scheduled for later this week a military official said Tuesday.    He said that until now the Iranian navy only had the capability to defend against electronic warfare. But new systems developed internally will give Iranian warships the capability of jamming enemy electronics the official said. He spoke on customary condition of anonymity.    The five-day maneuvers code-named Unity 77 will be launched later this week perhaps as early as Thursday with some 50000 troops participating.    The navy commander Rear Adm. Ali Akbar Ahmadian said Monday that Oman will send observers to the war games.    He said the maneuvers will take place in an area extending from the central Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf of Oman.    Iran has tried for a decade to conduct joint military exercises with Gulf states which are allies of the United States. But so far no Gulf country has agreed to take part because of Tehran's insistence that U.S. warships should leave the region.    The war games will involve missile-launching units of the Revolutionary Guards and mock ``electronic warfare will be carried out over a wide area'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.    Among the maneuvers' goals will be to assess Iran's defense against chemical biological and nuclear attacks IRNA said.    Iran concluded military exercises involving some 200000 troops on its border with Afghanistan last month after Afghanistan's Taliban militia killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
