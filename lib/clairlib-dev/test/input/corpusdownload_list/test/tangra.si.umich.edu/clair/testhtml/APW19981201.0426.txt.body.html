<HTML>    BEIJING AP  A strong earthquake jolted China's hilly southwest Tuesday causing several farmers' houses to collapse the Central Seismology Bureau reported.    There were no reports of casualties from the preliminary magnitude of 5.1 quake which struck Xuanwei county in Yunnan province shortly after 3:30 p.m. 0730 GMT state media and a bureau seismologist reported.    The quake toppled several houses in rural villages and cracked walls in one or two buildings in Xuanwei's county seat on the eastern edge of Yunnan said the seismologist who declined to be named.    Less than two weeks ago a pair of strong quakes killed five people injured 4000 and left 25000 homeless more than 300 kilometers 180 miles west of Xuanwei along Yunnan's northern border with Sichuan province.    The seismologist said Tuesday's quake was not related to the more catastrophic temblors which struck a few days ago.
