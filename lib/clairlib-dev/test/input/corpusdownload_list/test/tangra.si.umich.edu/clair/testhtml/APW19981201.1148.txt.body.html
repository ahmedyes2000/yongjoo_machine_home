<HTML>    LONDON AP  Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet left a north London psychiatric hospital Tuesday evening driven away in darkness to a house on an estate of magnificent houses in an ambulance in a convoy headed by police vehicles.    To chants of ``We want justice'' from demonstrators some shaking their fists the ambulance swept through the gates of Grovelands Priory at 6.45 p.m. 1845GMT a day after the hospital announced that the 83-year-old general does not need medical care and demanded that he leave.    An hour later the white ambulance with blacked out windows arrived at Wentworth estate in Surrey some 20 miles 30 kms west of central London.    A police helicopter circled overhead as the convoy drew into the estate of huge homes set in private grounds  many overlooking the fairways of Wentworth Golf Club home of the European golf tour.    Dozens of police arrived at roads leading into the estate and said they'd been ordered to say nothing.    Monday's statement by the hospital where Pinochet has been since Oct. 29 dealt a blow to any plan he had to plead he is too ill to be extradited to Spain to stand trial on charges of genocide and torture.    If Home Secretary Jack Straw who must rule by Dec. 11 allows extradition proceedings to begin Pinochet will likely be in Britain for months fighting his case through the courts.    His new neighbors face disruption. Chilean exiles mount demonstrations and there is a police guard and heavy police presence.    Earlier his lawyer 9th graf pvs    mj
