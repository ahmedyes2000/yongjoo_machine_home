<HTML>    GENEVA AP  Fighting in southeastern Congo has led to a new wave of Congolese refugees crossing Lake Tanganyika into Tanzania the U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday.    Several hundred refugees each day have been arriving in port villages in Tanzania's Rukwa region since mid-November said Kris Janowski spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.    The new arrivals say fighting in Congo's Shaba region as well as looting and the fear of being pressed into military service are behind the exodus Janowski said.    Around 50 refugees a day were arriving in the second week of November. But over the following week some 2500 crossed into Tanzania.    No adequate shelter is available in the lakeside villages for the refugees and their situation is being made worse by increasingly heavy rain.    UNHCR has transferred 1200 refugees north from their arrival points to Kigoma where camps are already established.    More than 18000 people have fled Congo for Tanzania during the four-month conflict between forces loyal to President Laurent Kabila and rebels based in Congo's eastern regions the agency says.    Namibia Zimbabwe and Angola are supporting Kabila against the rebels who have the backing of Rwanda and Uganda.  UR; gm
