<HTML>    PARIS AP  The all-news radio station France Info played music and some TV newscasts went dim during a one-day strike Tuesday by journalists protesting plans to do away with a 30 percent tax break.    It was impossible to measure the size of the work stoppage. The afternoon newspaper Le Monde reported that at least two Parisian newspapers the conservative Le Figaro and the Communist l'Humanite would not publish Wednesday along with numerous regional papers.    Others were expected to put out shortened editions.    It was the third protest since former Prime Minister Alain Juppe initiated legislation in 1996 to do away with tax breaks in 73 professions.    Unions have argued that the tax break constitutes a key element of journalists' salaries.    Efforts to devise a means of eliminating the tax break without making journalists feel the pinch quite so badly have so far come to naught.    eg-jn
