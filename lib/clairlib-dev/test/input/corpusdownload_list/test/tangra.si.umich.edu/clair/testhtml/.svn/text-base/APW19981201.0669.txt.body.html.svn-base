<HTML>    WARSAW Poland AP  Signaling further problems with an arms contract with Israeli companies a defense ministry spokesman said Tuesday that Israel failed to arrange tests of its NTD missiles in November as requested.    Poland wanted the tests held in November so that its experts could watch the missiles intended to arm Polish-made Huzar helicopters perform in local terrain and weather conditions.    ``We have been ready all along but the Israeli side did not name a date'' said Capt. Andrzej Adamczyk spokesman for deputy Defense Minister Romuald Szeremietiew. Adamczyk said there was no date set for the tests.    Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government planned to discuss the issue at a Cabinet-meeting Tuesday but decided to wait a week when Buzek and Industry Minister Jerzy Steinhof return from a visit to Mexico.    Following years of negotiating with several potential partners Poland last year awarded the dlrs 800 million contract to Israel's Rafael and Elbit Systems Ltd. to equip the Huzar helicopters in line with NATO requirements.    Poland which plans to join NATO in April selected the Israeli companies over the U.S. company Boeing.    Under the deal which required approval from both governments Rafael would supply the Huzar with anti-tank NTD missiles and Elbit would provide electronic integrating systems.    But Poland's Solidarity-led government which took office shortly after the agreement was signed criticized the handling of the tenders by its ex-communist predecessors and demanded missile tests. It also decided to seek another tender for the integrating systems but has set no date for it.    ms-tsc
