<HTML>    SUVA Fiji AP  The coalition deal announced this week by Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka will greatly improve his chances of retaining office after a general election expected in May.    Rabuka said Tuesday he had agreed with the National Federated and United General parties to work together with to set up a coalition. Rabuka heads the SVT or Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei meaning ``Fijian Political Party'' which heads the present government.    The National Federated Party or NFP is backed by the bulk of the Indian community that comprises 43 percent of the 800000 population. It controls two-thirds of Indian communal seats in the present Parliament and is expected to at least retain that strength after the May election.    The United General Party or UGP is backed by minority European European-Chinese and other small communities and is expected to emerge from the May election with at least the five seats it has in the present Parliament.    The NFP leader opposition leader Jai Ram Reddy is one of the government ministers ousted and jailed in 1987 when then Col. Rabuka led a Fijian nationalist coup against a newly elected Indian-dominated government.    Reddy and Rabuka reconciled in recent years and were the key figures in securing a democratic constitution as a replacement for one condemned internationally after it imposition by a post coup regime.    Since the new constitution does not guarantee Fijians the complete political supremacy they had under the former constitution Fijian nationalist extremist splinter groups have emerged with the aim of toppling Rabuka.    Local commentators say the splintering of Fijian loyalties plus anti-Rabuka parties backed by chiefs who disapprove of Rabuka's commoner background present a serious threat to Rabuka.    The agreement with the NFP and UGP should ensure him at least 25 or 30 seats in the new 71-seat Parliament in addition to the numbers he can reasonably hope to pick up for the SVT.
