<HTML>    KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia AP  A key police witness in the Anwar Ibrahim trial told the court Tuesday that he had tried and failed to win business favors from the former deputy prime minister but that was not why he was testifying against him.    The former police intelligence officer Amir Junos took the witness stand as the trial stumbled along amid the three-month jail sentence for a defense lawyer held in contempt of court.    The lawyer Zainur Zakaria who won a reprieve from a higher court that stayed his imprisonment pending an appeal hearing Friday was present in the court Tuesday.    Judge Augustine Paul handed down the sentence Monday after Zainur refused to apologize for an affidavit he had filed on behalf of Anwar seeking the removal of two prosecutors on grounds that they were allegedly fabricating evidence.    Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 two weeks after he was fired as deputy prime minister and finance minister. His subsequent jailing and beating while in custody has attracted international concern over the case.    Anwar is being tried on four counts of corruption. He will be tried on another corruption count as well as five counts of sexual misconduct at a later date.    Anwar denies the charges calling them part of a political vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.    Monday's sideshow interrupted the main trial when a stumped defense team asked for an adjournment to recover from the blow.    Resuming Tuesday to defend Anwar against allegations that he abused his power to cover up alleged sexual misdeeds lawyer Christopher Fernando asked Amir whether he held a grudge against Anwar because his request had been denied.    ``I have no intent to come to the court and exaggerate and embellish my testimony in an effort to embarrass Anwar'' he said.    He had earlier admitted during cross-examination to asking Anwar for equity in a securities firm and business deals for his friends.    Amir was called as a witness by the prosecution to prove allegations that Anwar had directed the police to harass and intimidate two people who had alleged that Anwar had sex with his secretary's wife and had sodomized his chauffeur.
