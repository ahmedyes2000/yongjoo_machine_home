KUWAIT AP  The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange fell by 10.04 percent in November closing the month at 1777.1 points a market report by the National Investments Co. said Tuesday.    The decline was caused by low oil prices and the crisis between Iraq and the United Nations over weapons inspectors the report said.    A local controversy over a government proposal to pump money into the exchange also contributed to the fall the report said. The central bank governor Sheik Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah was reported to have resigned to protest a decision by a ministerial committee to allow investment companies to extend special loans to investors.    The dispute ended when the Cabinet allowed the central bank to decide if the exchange needed the extra funding.    The report said some 506.86 million shares changed hands in the 21 days of trading during November down 24.9 percent from those traded during the same number of days in October. The value of these shares also dropped by 34.41 percent to 99.43 million dinars dlrs 329.2 million. The figures were the lowest this year.

Dalabeeh declined to elaborate but he appeared to be referring to the Jordanian government's decision to impose stringent measures on Egyptians seeking work in Jordan.    Iraq Jordan's largest trade partner has used Aqaba for much of its imports since its own ports were heavily damaged during the 1991 Gulf war.    Dalabeeh said the total volume of goods handled at Aqaba between January and October this year was 10.4 million tones 2 percent more than during the same period in 1997.
