<HTML>    KUPANG Indonesia AP  Christian mobs burned two houses a car and a motorcycle Tuesday on the second day of unrest in a provincial capital of Indonesia where rioters burned and ransacked 15 mosques.    In a separate outburst of religious violence Muslim crowds hurled stones at two homes used for Christian worship as well as a shop and a cinema on Java Indonesia's main island.    The riots raised fears that tit-for-tat attacks on places of worship will escalate in the world's most populous Muslim nation which is already enduring severe economic and political turmoil.    ``We condemn all burning of houses of God'' President B.J. Habibie said Tuesday. ``We condemn it whether it is the burning of churches or mosques or Buddhist temples or whatever.''    On Tuesday frightened Muslims with sickles and swords guarded their homes and mosques in the Christian-dominated city of Kupang the capital of East Nusa Tenggara province.    Thousands of people many of them armed roamed the streets and attacked several buildings. However heavy rain doused fires set by arsonists and the military reported calm by the afternoon.    Most shops were shut and there was no public transport. Residents swept up debris from the rioting.    ``I feel very sad and shocked'' said Kamtina Ibrahim a 26-year-old Muslim woman standing in front of the main mosque in the city of 120000. Stone-throwing rioters had shoved in the doors and shattered most of the windows.    The attacks on Kupang's mosques on Monday were in retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim mobs in Jakarta on Nov. 22 when 14 people were killed some hacked to death.    In apparent revenge mobs early Tuesday smashed windows of two private houses where Christians worshipped in Banjarsari 155 miles 250 kilometers southeast of Jakarta police and witnesses said.    They denied earlier reports by the military that the two houses had been burned.    About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims with the rest following Christian Hindu Buddhist or other faiths. Some cities in the sprawling archipelago nation have Christian majorities.    Many army reinforcements had rushed to Kupang from the nearby territory of East Timor where separatist rebels have been fighting the Indonesian military since 1975.    Police said they had detained alleged instigators of the riots the official Antara news agency reported. Authorities did not say how many people were being questioned.    Muhammad Djaffar chairman of the local mosque council said 15 mosques were burned or vandalized Monday in Kupang 1875 kilometers 1172 miles southeast of Jakarta.    Crowds also burned down a market a Muslim school and a hostel for Islamic pilgrims. Several other small places of Islamic worship as well as dozens of shops were also set on fire.    Djaffar criticized the security forces saying they reacted slowly to the unrest and showed little desire to confront the mobs. There were no reports of arrests.    The military its credibility sagging because of its involvement in human rights abuses has been overstretched as it tries to keep order in the turbulent Southeast Asian nation.    Four mosques were burned and 13 people were injured said F.K. Lerik the Protestant mayor of Kupang. Air services to Kupang were canceled Tuesday because of security concerns.    Hoping to cool tensions Kupang's Roman Catholic Bishop Petrus Turang apologized for the burnings. Islamic leaders across the nation urged their followers not to retaliate with more violence.    Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the national philosophy known as Pancasila adopted when Indonesia declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.    The upsurge in religious violence follows months of riots and protests in many parts of Indonesia.    Social tensions in Indonesia fueled by widespread unemployment have intensified amid the worst economic crisis in decades.    There is also political turmoil as students protesters demand greater democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule by former President Suharto who was forced to quit following deadly riots in May.
