<HTML>    UPPER MARLBORO Maryland AP  In the hallway outside the courtrooom Riddick Bowe and Chris Webber shook hands and wished each other the best.    It would have been a sure double-take for any sports fan who happened to be wandering down the second-floor hallway in the Prince George's County Courthouse on Monday. But there they were two famous athletes having to share a courthouse to answer accusations of violence.    Webber a Sacramento Kings forward was about to stand trial on charges of assaulting a police officer resisting arrest possession of marijuana and several other offenses. The judge spent the morning hearing a pretrial motion but the start of the actual trial was delayed because the same judge had to deal with Bowe a former heavyweight champion accused of assaulting his wife.    Bowe wasn't around very long. It only took Judge Hovey Johnson a few minutes to shelve the second-degree assault charge from August 1997 on the conditions that Bowe have no violent conduct with his wife and that he complete a 10-day psychiatric evaluation and any accompanying treatments.    Then Bowe emerged and encountered Webber. The two shook hands and exchanged a good-luck pats on the shoulder. Webber was impeccably dressed in a gray suit; Bowe wore blue jeans and a dark New York Yankees championship T-shirt half tucked in.    As jury selection began in Webber's case there were passing references to his celebrity status. About 90 percent of the jury pool said they had heard about the case but only four said the publicity would effect their judgement. One of the four after being dismissed turned and said ``Good luck Chris'' before leaving the courtroom.    The unusual Webber-Bowe docket didn't attract any sort of crowd. Maybe they were waiting for Tuesday when Webber's trial resumes and another former champ Mike Tyson appears in court in neighboring Montgomery County on charges he attacked two men after a traffic accident in August.
