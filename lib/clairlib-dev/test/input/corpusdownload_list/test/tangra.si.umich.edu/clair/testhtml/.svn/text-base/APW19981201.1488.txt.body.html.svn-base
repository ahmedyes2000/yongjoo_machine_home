<HTML>    SEOUL South Korea AP  In a move that will facilitate organ transplants South Korea plans to recognize a brain dead person as legally dead beginning next year.    The Ministry of Health and Welfare said Wednesday that legislation will be enacted this month to legalize transplants of the heart liver and other vital organs from a brain dead person.    Currently the heart must have stopped for a person to be recognized as dead.    The legislation calls for the establishment of medical teams of up to 10 members at the nation's major hospitals to decide whether a person is brain dead.    A centralized organ donor center will also be established to ease the matching of donors to recipients.    With two ruling coalition parties enjoying a majority in the National Assembly and backing from the main opposition party the bill is expected to be passed without difficulty.
