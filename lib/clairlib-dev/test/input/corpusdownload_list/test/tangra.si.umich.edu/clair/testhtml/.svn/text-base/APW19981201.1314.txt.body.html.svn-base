<HTML>    BUENOS AIRES Argentina AP  Argentina's San Lorenzo hopes a well-rested squad will give them a lift over Brazil's Cruzeiro Wednesday to advance to the Mercosur Cup finals.    The Argentine team lost the first semifinal leg in Brazil 1-0 and now needs a win plus a goal differential advantage to face Brazil's Palmeiras in the tournament's finals.    ``This game is life or death'' said San Lorenzo coach Alfio Basile who rested his players during recent league matches in preparation for Wednesday's game.    Basile said his team is nearly injury-free except for striker Alberto Acosta who is still bothered by a left leg injury but is expected to play.    Now that Boca Juniors has won the Argentine league championship San Lorenzo is hoping a good showing in Mercosur Cup will generate momentum for next season.    The game is scheduled to begin at 0010 GMT.    Probable lineups:    San Lorenzo: Oscar Passet Horacio Ameli Eduardo Tuzzio Ivan Cordoba Eduardo Coudet Claudio Rivadero Federico Lussenhoff Federico Basabilvaso Nestor Gorosito Raul Estevez and Alberto Acosta.    Cruzeiro: Paulo Cesar Gustavo Marcelo Dijan Gottardo Gilberto Marcos Paulo Djair Valdo Muller Marcelo Ramos and Fabio Junior.
