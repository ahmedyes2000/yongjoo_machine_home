An embassy official speaking on condition of anonymity said the Foreign Ministry had informed the embassy that the trio  an American a Canadian and a German  were taken to a border checkpoint and sent back to Thailand. The ministry did not disclose precisely when or where.    U.S. consular officials never received access to the American identified as Michael John Raedeke 40 the official said. The other tourists have been identified as Joseph Frank 34 a Canadian resident of Hong Kong and Dirk Rommeswinkel of Germany.    Myanmar officials confirmed last week that the trio had been found inside the country also known as Burma and were brought to Taunggyi about 175 kilometers 110 miles from where they were detained for questioning by immigration officials.    The tourists were seen riding rented motorcycles in the rugged border region around Thailand's western Mae Hong Son province. Thai troops saw them drive across the frontier at Ban Mai Kai On Pass but were unable to get their attention.    Myanmar has strict security measures in the border regions. Armed rebel groups have been active in some areas.
