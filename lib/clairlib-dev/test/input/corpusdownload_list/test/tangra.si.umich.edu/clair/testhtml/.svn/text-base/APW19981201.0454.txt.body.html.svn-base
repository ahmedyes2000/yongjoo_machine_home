<HTML>    LONDON AP  Newspapers lashed out Tuesday after yet another humiliation for England's cricket team.    ``Day England lost all credibility'' said a blaring headline in The Express.    ``That's the worst I have seen in 83 test matches'' said The Mirror quoting England captain Alec Stewart.    ``One of our worst ever performances'' echoed The Sun.    England's seven-wicket hammering by Australia Monday in the second Test of the Ashes series  England was bowled out for 112 in 39 overs on the opening day  again reminded the nation how far it has slipped in a game it invented.    To make matters worse on the same day England was battered upstart Zimbabwe  the lowest ranked of the nine Test-playing sides  picked up its first overseas Test win when it beat Pakistan by seven wickets.    Writing under a headline calling England ``second-raters on cricket's world stage'' The Express columnist James Lawton said the loss reflected deeper problems.    ``It is not just the specter of another defeat which makes someone who cares for England's cricket legacy feel here like a man walking down Park Lane with holes in his shoes'' he said.    ``The grimness of this conclusion is that it may be that our cricket future is drifting beyond our own hands'' he added.    He was referring to a suggestion from former Australia captain Ian Chappel that England may no longer rate five-Test status against Australia.    ``I just don't know how we can keep handing out the five Tests to England when teams like Pakistan and South Africa are beginning to mean a lot more to the young people here'' he quoted Chappel as saying.    England has won just four of the last 30 Ashes matches to Australia's 18 and the defeat inside three days means Australia needs to win only one of the next three Tests to retain the Ashes.    The Daily Mail said even the Australian reserves were good enough to beat England.    ``Australia's second 11 could probably beat the tourists as well'' wrote columnist Bob Willis.    scw
