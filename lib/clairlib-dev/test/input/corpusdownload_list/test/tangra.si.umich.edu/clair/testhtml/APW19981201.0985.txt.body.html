<HTML>    LONDON AP  The British Foreign Office said Tuesday it would not intervene on behalf of a British woman convicted of heroin trafficking in Thailand and seeking to have her 22-year prison sentence reduced.    Sandra Gregory 33 was convicted in 1996 and sentenced to 25 years in a Thai prison after being stopped at the Bangkok airport with more than 100 grams 3.5 ounces of heroin. Her sentence was later reduced to 22 years under a general amnesty from the King of Thailand and she was transferred to a British prison last year under a British-Thai prisoner exchange treaty.    In a letter published in Tuesday's edition of the Scotsman newspaper Stan and Doreen Gregory say they believe the government should write to the King of Thailand requesting a reduction in the sentence.    But a Foreign Office spokesman said that won't happen.    ``Sandra is already serving her sentence in the United Kingdom and it is government policy not to intervene and support Royal Pardon petitions where the subject is in jail in this country'' said the spokesman speaking on the customary condition of anonymity. ``In addition we would only consider supporting such a petition if there were strong compassionate grounds such as if the prisoner was terminally ill.    ``That is not the case and while we are sympathetic to Sandra's family we have to bear in mind she has been convicted of a serious drug smuggling offense involving heroin'' the spokesman said.
