<HTML>    TOKYO AP  The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early Wednesday largely carrying over its weakness overseas. Japanese stock prices bounced back in light trading.    The dollar bought 121.84 yen in early trading down 0.94 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 122.17 yen overnight.    The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 161.51 points or 1.09 percent to 14996.92 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Tuesday the Nikkei closed down 48.29 points or 0.32 percent.    In currency dealings the dollar remained weak against the yen partly after the release of disappointing U.S. economic data.    The National Association of Purchasing Management reported Tuesday the manufacturing sector in the United States slowed for the sixth consecutive month in November.    On the stock market share prices rebounded on short covering after falling moderately the past three trading sessions.    Market players said trading will likely remain in a narrow range because of a lack of fresh news on the Japanese government's economic policies. Parliament is discussing a government-sponsored supplementary budget to spur the nation's sagging economy.    The Tokyo market was also supported by an overnight gain on Wall Street where the Dow Jones industrial average finished 16.99 points higher or 0.2 percent at 9133.54 on Tuesday.    The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first section was up 5.69 points or 0.50 percent to 1147.95. The TOPIX closed down 1.24 points or 0.11 percent the day before.    The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond was quoted at 1.160 percent up from Tuesday's close of 1.140 percent. Its price fell to 105.49 yen from the previous day's 105.68.  UR; km-dj
