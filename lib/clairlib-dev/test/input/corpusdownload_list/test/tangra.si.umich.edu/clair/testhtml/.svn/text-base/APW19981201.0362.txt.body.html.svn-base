<HTML>    ATHENS Greece AP  Gas stations began running dry Tuesday with deliveries halted by a customs strike.    A court was expected to rule on a government request to declare the strike illegal and order workers back to their posts.    Many filling stations had ``no gasoline'' signs hanging from the pumps. At others motorists formed long lines to fill up their vehicles.    Greeks worry about shortages of gasoline and heating oil as tankers and trucks were unable to unload their cargo because of the five-day strike which began Monday.    Union officials called the strike to protest government plans to unify pension funds from various agencies.    The walkout is just one of many planned strikes around Greece this week. There is growing labor union opposition to government austerity plans aimed at qualifying Greece for the European Union's single currency club by 2001.    Doctors at state-run hospitals also began strikes on Monday. Railway workers are scheduled to participate in work stoppages beginning Wednesday. Civil aviation workers also plan work stoppages which could disrupt flights.    A trolley strike that was to begin Tuesday was called off but bus drivers tax officials and school teachers are still planning walkouts.    tt-bm
