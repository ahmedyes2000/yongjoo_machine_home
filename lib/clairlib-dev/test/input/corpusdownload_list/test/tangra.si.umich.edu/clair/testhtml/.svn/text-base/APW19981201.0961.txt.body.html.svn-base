<HTML>    BRUSSELS Belgium AP - Hopes of a reprieve for duty free sales for travelers within the European Union appeared short-lived Tuesday as a proposal to delay a planned abolition failed to gain sufficient support among EU finance ministers.    France proposed extending the life of the popular tax-free sales on flights ports and ferry crossings for five years beyond June 30 1999 when the EU is scheduled to scrap them. Germany and Britain backed the proposal along with Greece Spain and Ireland.    However the bid to save duty-free shopping needed support from all 15 EU nations and Denmark the Netherlands Portugal Italy Finland and Sweden refused to budge. Austria Belgium and Luxembourg did not take a stance.    In 1991 EU nations all voted to abolish the tax free shopping claiming it was incompatible with the notion of a borderless EU market. They need unanimity to reverse that decision.  UR; Airlines shipping 5th graf
