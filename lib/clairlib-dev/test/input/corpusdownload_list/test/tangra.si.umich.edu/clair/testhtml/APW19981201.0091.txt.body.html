<HTML>    KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia AP  Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos Horta on Tuesday called for the release of an outspoken Malaysian human rights activist who was arrested during an anti-government demonstration.    ``I demand that the Malaysian police immediately release Tian Chua and all those arrested at the pro-reformasi demonstration'' Ramos Horta said in a statement faxed from Sydney Australia.    Tian was arrested Nov. 21 shortly after a demonstration by supporters of jailed former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.    It was the third time that Tian chairman of the opposition Coalition of People's Democracy had been picked up by police for demanding political reforms and protesting against the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.    Tian won a bail appeal Monday. But as soon as he walked out of the courthouse police nabbed him and arrested him again.    On Tuesday Tian appeared at a courthouse in his Kuala Lumpur neighborhood of Petaling Jaya. The judge did not charge him with a crime but ordered him to be held for five days while police investigate possible charges.    The judge also ordered that Tian be taken to a hospital for treatment of asthma.    ``I'm fine -- and they did not beat me up in the lock-up yesterday'' Tian told supporters outside the courthouse. ``Keep up the fight.''    Members of Tian's coalition which comprises 20 human rights and opposition political groups have protested that he was beaten while in police custody.    ``Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad together with his Gestapo-like police force in their vendetta against reform-minded Anwar Ibrahim is ripping away the foundations of justice and democracy in Malaysia'' Ramos Horta said.    ``This has to stop immediately.''    Ramos Horta who promotes independence for Indonesian East Timor praised Tian's role in that struggle.    ``Tian Chua is in the forefront of the struggle for freedom and democracy in Malaysia and is well-known in the region for his brave stand against the Indonesian occupation of East Timor'' he said.
