<HTML>    ATHENS Greece AP  When Cyprus ordered surface-to-air missiles it was hoping to enhance its security against its longtime foe Turkey.    Suddenly however it's Cyprus' main ally  Greece  that is feeling nervous about introducing new firepower to the divided island.    Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides last week rebuffed an offer by Greek officials to place the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in a less provocative site the Greek island of Crete.    Now Athens is growing edgy that a potential military showdown in Cyprus over the missiles could knock Athens from its real battle: conquering its fiscal troubles and joining the European Union single currency club.    ``The last thing Greece wants is anything interfering with its EU goals'' said Constantine Karistinos a researcher at the Institute for International Relations an Athens-based think tank.    Deciding the fate of the Russian-made missiles has accomplished an unusual feat in the politics of the region: separating rhetoric from reality.    Greece has always been ready with strong words of support for Greek Cypriots who ordered the missiles in 1996 in response to Turkey's purchase of long-range American artillery. Turkey has warned it could use its powerful military to take out the proposed missiles.    Turkey maintains about 30000 troops in the northern third of the Mediterranean island divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded following a short-lived coup by backers of union with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes the breakaway northern republic.    Greece formed a defense pact with Cyprus in 1993 and inaugurated a Greek-built military air base this year.    But back in Greece Premier Costas Simitis was marshaling all his forces for the single currency quest. Greece failed to meet the fiscal guidelines on the first round and Simitis has made entry by 2001 his main focus.    His Socialist party has shown unprecedented resolve against waves of labor protests and strikes. Market analysts and EU officials have recently encouraged Simitis' efforts to tame inflation and reduce state debt.    ``Now we're being trapped by the Cypriots'' cried political commentator Aris Tolios on Flash radio.    In financial terms a costly military mobilization to support Cyprus could set back Greece's austerity goals. There also could be a high psychological cost for Greece some experts say.    ``It could deflect the focus from the EU to Cyprus just when the Greek government needs to fully concentrate on the single currency drive'' said Karistinos on Monday.    The United States and EU also have urged Cyprus to cancel or delay the deployment. U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke will try to restart Cyprus talks during a trip through the region in December.    Last week the Simitis government unsuccessfully lobbied Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides to accept the Crete alternative for the missiles  which are still sitting in a Russian warehouse and are now not expected to be delivered until early next year.    But Clerides apparently fears the political fallout from the perception of backing down to Turkish demands.    ``We cannot lift up our arms and surrender whenever we face a threat'' said Cypriot Socialist leader Vassos Lyssarides whose party has two members in the cabinet.    In Greece the Cypriot snub has put the flame on simmering ill feelings. Many Greeks privately complain about what they consider a lopsided alliance especially considering Cyprus' galloping economy. But such grumbling is rarely voiced publicly out of respect for their mutual mistrust of Turkey.    The missile dispute may change the rules.    The Eleftheros Typos newspaper reported that Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos berated Cyprus' defense minister Giannakis Omirou for comments about Greece's efforts to move the missiles to Crete.    ``The ... missiles are turning into a wound for Greece'' the Vradini newspaper commented.
