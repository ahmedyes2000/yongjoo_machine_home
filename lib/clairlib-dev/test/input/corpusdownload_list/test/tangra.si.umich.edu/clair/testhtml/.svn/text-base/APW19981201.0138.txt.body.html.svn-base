<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  President Boris Yeltsin is feeling better but is still spending part of the day in bed as he continues to be treated for pneumonia officials said Tuesday.    A Kremlin spokesman said the president was doing limited paperwork and there were no plans for any meetings or visitors. He did not say how much longer Yeltsin would remain in the government hospital where he has been for 10 days.    Yeltsin met his chief-of-staff Valentin Yumashev in the hospital Monday and was briefed on government and national affairs.

Like most footage of Yeltsin released in recent weeks Monday's tape didn't contain any sound of the president speaking.
