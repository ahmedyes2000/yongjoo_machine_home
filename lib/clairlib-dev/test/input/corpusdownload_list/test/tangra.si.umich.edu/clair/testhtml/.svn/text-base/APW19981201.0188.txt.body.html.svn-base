<HTML>    JAKARTA Indonesia AP  Soldiers blocked about 200 student protesters from marching Tuesday on the house of Indonesia's former President Suharto.    Suharto 77 resigned in May after deadly riots and protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule. Critics accused him of siphoning off state wealth to benefit his family's massive business empires.    Tuesday's protest was the latest in a series against Suharto who has denied allegations of wrongdoing.    There were no arrests or injuries.    Earlier the students protested outside Jakarta's United Nations office and demanded that several retired army generals including Suharto be prosecuted for corruption and human rights abuses.    They also demanded that current military commander Gen. Wiranto be put on trial.    Suharto's successor and former protege President B.J. Habibie has ordered a commission of inquiry be set up to investigate Suharto's wealth.    An earlier investigation by Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib failed to find any evidence against Suharto. Many rejected it as a whitewash.    On Monday the government postponed the appointment of the new inquiry after it admitted that not enough people had agreed to serve on the body.    Student protesters have repeatedly tried to march on Suharto's home in recent weeks but have been blocked by troops.
