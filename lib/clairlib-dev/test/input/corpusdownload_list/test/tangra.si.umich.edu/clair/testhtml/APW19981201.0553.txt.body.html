<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  President Boris Yeltsin is feeling better but is still spending part of the day in a hospital bed as he continues to be treated for pneumonia officials said Tuesday.    A Kremlin spokesman said the president was doing limited paperwork and there were no plans for any meetings or visitors. He did not say how much longer Yeltsin would remain in the government hospital where he has been for 10 days.    Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev said on Tuesday that the president is expected to return to work at the Kremlin ``in the nearest time.''    ``Doctors are having trouble keeping the president in the hospital'' Sysuyev said at a news conference.    The 67-year-old leader is known as a restless patient who sometimes ignores the advice of his doctors.    Yeltsin met his chief-of-staff Valentin Yumashev in the hospital Monday and was briefed on government and national affairs.    On Tuesday the president spoke by telephone with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov who discussed the agenda of his talks with International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus set to arrive in Moscow later today.
