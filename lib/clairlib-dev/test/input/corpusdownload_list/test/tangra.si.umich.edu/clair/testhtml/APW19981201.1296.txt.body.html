<HTML>    UDINE Italy AP  Argentine defender Mauro Esteban Navas scored the game winner in second-half injury time as Udinese downed Parma 3-2 in a first-leg game of the Italian Cup quarterfinals Tuesday night.    The powerful long-distance drive by Navas in the 92nd could not be stopped by Hernan Crespo Parma's Argentine striker who played the final minutes as keeper to substitute for injured goalie Matteo Guardalben.    Crespo had tallied Parma's 2-2 equalizer in the 76th minute before being forced between his team posts.    Guardalben could not be replaced by another keeper when he was injured in the 85th as Parma had already completed the allowed substitutions.    It was an unexpected loss for the Parma team which came from a 4-0 rout of AC Milan in a league match last Sunday. The home triumph vaulted Parma to second place in the Serie A standings.    Ghanian teenage star Stephan Appiah put Udinese in front with a right drive from 8 meters in the 39th minute at the Friuli stadium.    Argentine veteran striker Abel Balbo needed only two minutes to tie the score in the 41st on a perfect pass by teammate Diego Fuser.    Brazilian striker Amoruso who has tallied 8 goals in 11 league matches gave Udinese a 2-1 lead in the 46th with a precise diagonal shot.    Amoruso was warmly applauded by the partisan crowd as he left the field with a light chest bruise in the 65th.    Crespo rested for most of the game made it 2-2 minutes after entering the field and shortly before the unhappy end as a keeper.
