<HTML>    ISTANBUL Turkey AP  Authorities assigned more than 20000 policemen to a politically charged Champions League match Wednesday pitting Juventus of Italy against Turkey's Galatasaray.    ``We will do our best to start and finish the game without any incidents'' Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas told reporters Tuesday. ``Everyone should know that this is a sports competition.''    The tight security measures are intended to protect Juventus players from any possible acts by Turks angry at Italy for refusing to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader.    Because Turkey has the death penalty Italy has refused to return Abdullah Ocalan who was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12 Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey for 14 years and the Turkish government holds him responsible for thousands of deaths.    Aktas said that police will use a heavy hand against troublemakers warning that ``whoever gets involved in provocative acts will be severely punished.''    Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz called on Turks to keep their calm and dignity.    Private NTV television said some 22000 policemen were assigned to the match. Aktas said military units would also be called in.    The game will be played after a one-week postponement by European soccer's governing body UEFA for security concerns. Tension has declined since then.    Mass circulation dailies also called on the fans to stay calm.    ``Welcome Juve'' headlined the daily Hurriyet in Italian saying Turks would put to shame those who have said Turkey was unsafe by showing ``maturity and hospitality.''    NTV said police would search spectators entering the Ali Sami Yen stadium for knives and clubs. Banners and fireworks are also banned.    Roads to be used by Juventus players will be cordoned off daily Milliyet said.    But it was not clear if the measures would ease Juventus' concerns.    Juventus general director Luiciano Moggi said Monday that they ``will not be going calmly'' to Istanbul.    In a concession to the players' misgivings the club announced it would fly to Istanbul hours before the game and depart immediately after the match. Juventus had planned to head to Istanbul on Tuesday.    Several Juventus players including French World Cup hero Zinedine Zidane had threatened to refuse to play in Istanbul.    ``We were kind of forced to go to play. We're very worried'' Juventus 'keeper Angelo Peruzzi said Monday. ``UEFA and the Italian and Turkish governments know that they have taken on a big responsibility.''    Prior to the UEFA postponement demonstrators set fire to a Fiat car a motorbike and numerous Italian flags.    Italy's ministers of sport and culture and of foreign trade said they were going to Istanbul for the match.    Galatasaray has accused UEFA of favoring the Italian team by postponing the game and allegedly giving injured Juventus players time to recover.    Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim vowed to defeat Juve.    ``Hopefully we will write history'' sports daily Foto Mac quoted Terim as saying Tuesday. ``Italians will return empty handed.''    Romanian striker Gheorghe Hagi of Galatasaray was more cautious.    ``Ignoring Juventus' power would be suicide'' Hagi said.    Galatasaray has seven points in Group B one behind Norway's Rosenborg. Juventus has four but both teams have played one fewer game than the Norwegians.    sh/vls/fd
