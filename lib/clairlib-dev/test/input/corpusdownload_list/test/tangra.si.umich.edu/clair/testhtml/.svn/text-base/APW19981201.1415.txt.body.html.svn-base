<HTML>    KABUL Afghanistan AP  Tightly wrapped against the cold that seeps through the damp walls of Kabul's children's hospital 4-month-old Aminullah struggles to survive.    Doctors say the malnourished boy who is barely the size of a newborn has little chance of making it through the frigid Afghan winter when temperatures sink well below freezing.    The winter will be much harder this year after international aid groups pulled out of the capital city rather than follow rules imposed by the Taliban religious army.    ``I don't know what to do. ... He is so hungry'' says Aminullah's mother Huzra as she rocks him gently back and forth at the Indira Gandhi Hospital a multi-story cement building where the wind whistles through the cold hallways.    The hospital has few supplies. The pharmacy is bare. The only ambulance has been locked away on the compound of one of the many aid groups that left the city earlier this year.    After two decades of war in Afghanistan Kabul is a desperate city. Entire neighborhoods lie in ruin. Food stalls in the market are often full but too expensive for the poorest.    The glucose drip attached to Aminullah's hand was bought in the market and the dirty woolen blanket Huzra pulls tightly around her shoulders was brought from her home in the ruins of Kabul.    In front of the Ministry of Public Health workers load about a dozen pieces of firewood onto a battered steel food trolley and push it a little over a mile two kilometers to the children's hospital.    ``Every day the children are complaining that they are cold ... but we have no fuel no wood nothing'' says hospital administrator Maulvi Hajji Nasruddin. ``We have no way to get anything. ... We have only God.''    In July dozens of aid groups pulled out of Kabul to protest a Taliban order forcing them to relocate to abandon school dormitories.    Negotiations are currently underway for some to return. At least 15 groups are expected to come back in the coming months still a significant drop from the more than 40 that once worked in the capital.    The United Nations is waiting for security guarantees and a promise of cooperation from the Taliban before allowing its international staff to return. The United Nations has complained of interference since the religious army took Kabul in September 1996.    The group controls 90 percent of the country where it has imposed its strict version of Islamic law.    The international Red Cross and the United Nations estimate that more than 500000 people in Kabul  or two-thirds of the city  depend on international aid to survive.    One vital service that continued despite the aid groups' pullout was a program of bakeries throughout the capital that provides subsidized bread to the poorest.    For some the bakeries run by the World Food Program the Red Cross and CARE International supply their only food other than heavily sugared tea.    ``In winter there is a great need. ... This year it will be worse because assistance is limited. The international agencies are not here to help'' said Zia Nasir field officer for the World Food Program in Kabul.    For women like Raeza whose husband was killed when a rocket smashed into their home the bread is all that is saving her and her seven children from ruin. For dinner most nights she serves bread and hot water.    ``Sometimes I beg. ... Some families know I am poor and they bring their old clothes to me'' says Raeza who like many Afghans uses only one name her barefoot daughter clinging to her blackened skirt.    In the ruins of Kabul Lailama Afghani clutches her feverish baby in her arms and slumps to the cold ground frightened at the prospect of another winter.    Her husband is sick. Her home is a bombed-out hovel in the middle of a rocket-ruined neighborhood a victim of the bitter factional fighting that followed the end of communist rule here in 1992.    Against the bitterly cold nights she has only one wool blanket for warmth.    ``Feel my baby. He has a fever but I have no medicine no money. What can I do?'' she asks the burqa she is forced to wear slung over her head to expose her face.    At an orphanage where 350 children live in an unheated building there is no money for blankets or warm clothing. Some of the smallest children have no shoes. The Red Cross had agreed to supply the orphanage with wood. The impoverished Taliban government has nothing to offer.    ``This will be the worst winter. ... We have no economy. This government is like a sick person in the desert'' said orphanage director Maulvi Mohammed Asif.
