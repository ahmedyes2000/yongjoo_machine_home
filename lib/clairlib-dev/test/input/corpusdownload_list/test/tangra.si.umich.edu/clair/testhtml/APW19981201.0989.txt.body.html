<HTML>    THE HAGUE Netherlands AP  The man calling himself the ``Serb Adolf'' seemed to enjoy murdering and torturing hundreds of Muslim prisoners of war a witness testified Tuesday at a U.N. trial.    Goran Jelisic a 30-year-old Bosnian Serb stands accused of genocide before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal. He has already pleaded guilty to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats at a Serbian-run detention camp near the northern Bosnian town of Brcko in 1992.    ``I think he took pleasure in doing this because he was so powerful'' said a 53-year-old Muslim camp survivor identified only as Witness B. ``He said it was nice to kill.''    Although his guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war crimes and crimes against humanity  and the likelihood of a maximum life sentence  Jelisic has denied that the killing spree constituted genocide.    By trying him for genocide U.N. prosecutors will be able to call evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders including the involvement of more senior Serbs.    During the testimony the former mechanic who called himself Adolf sat calmly alternately leaning forward on the table in front of him or slumping in his chair.    A Muslim witness continuing his testimony from Monday's opening day detailed Jelisic's alleged brutality against Muslims.    Jelisic and other camp guards tortured and killed people at will Witness A said calling Jelisic ``a beast.''    ``They simply knew we were Muslims and Croats. They simply wanted to eradicate us'' said Witness A who was allowed to take a short break after he began to sob on the stand.    ``I think this was killing of pleasure out of some kind of hate against my people. Those of us that survived... we all believe he tried to inflict as much pain as possible'' he said.    Set up in 1993 by the U.N. Security Council the tribunal has convicted two Muslims two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder rape and torture but it has yet to register a conviction for genocide the gravest offense the court recognizes.    Jelisic faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for each offense. His trial is expected to last well into 1999.    Another witness said he was taken to the Luka detention camp with two busloads of Muslims. Witness B another Muslim said Jelisic immediately confiscated their identification papers.    Jelisic called out names and said they would be executed. Then he laughed and said he was only joking the witness testified.    Witness B recounted that Jelisic interrogated visitors who said they were visiting inmates for the May Day holiday he accused them of lying the witness said.    ``He said `This will by your last May Day' and took them out and killed them'' the witness said.
