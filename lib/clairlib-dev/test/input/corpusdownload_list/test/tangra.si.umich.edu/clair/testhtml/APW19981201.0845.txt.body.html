<HTML>    ANKARA Turkey AP  Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Tuesday said that Italy or Germany should try a Kurdish rebel leader detained in Rome if Turkey's extradition bid fails.    Speaking to members of his center-right party in Parliament Yilmaz said that if Italy refuses to hand over rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan ``the least you can do is to make sure that his crimes do not remain unpunished.''    Turkey wants Ocalan extradited but Italy refuses to hand him over since Italian law forbids forbid extradition to countries like Turkey where suspects may face the death penalty.    Ocalan is also wanted in Germany but German officials fearing trouble among its Kurdish and Turkish immigrant population say they will not seek his extradition.    ``You issue a warrant for crimes committed on your territory ... but then you shy away from trying him'' Yilmaz dded in a clear reference to Germany. ``What kind of a legal state is this?''    Turkey has been angered by a proposal by the prime ministers of Germany and Italy for an international tribunal to try Ocalan which Ankara accuses of terrorism.    The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast since 1984 in a war that has killed 37000 people.    Turkey's approximately 12 million Kurds are not recognized as an official minority and are denied education and broadcasting rights.    In Rome the Chamber of Deputies Parliament's lower house scheduled a debate on the Ocalan dilemma for early Wednesday evening following a speech on the issue by leftist Premier Massimo D'Alema.    sf-fd
