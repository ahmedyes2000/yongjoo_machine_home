<HTML>    TOKYO AP  U.S. spy satellites have detected North Koreans preparing to launch another missile and Tokyo has been warned a Japanese newspaper reported Wednesday.    The North Koreans have been moving parts of their new Taepo Dong missile from storage to the launch pad since about Nov. 20 the Yomiuri newspaper reported citing Japanese government sources that had received word from the United States.    Japan is worried that the North is likely to launch another missile later this year said the Yomiuri Japan's largest daily in a front-page article.    Government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka acknowledged Wednesday that Tokyo was aware of ``some kind of movement'' in North Korea. He would not elaborate.    Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi confirmed Japan had received ``various information'' about a North Korean launch in the works but Kyodo News agency quoted him as saying ``I have not heard that it has been confirmed.''    The Defense Agency would not comment on the Yomiuri report.    Japanese were unnerved by the firing of a rocket by North Korea on Aug. 31. Believed to be a test of its Taepo Dong the rocket flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean proving the communist nation can strike any part of the country.    Japan has a peaceful rocket program but no spy satellite of its own and must rely on the United States for information about the threat from North Korean missiles.    A joint missile defense system with the United States has been proposed and Japan approved a plan to put four spy satellites into orbit by 2002.    North Korea which says it put a satellite in orbit with the August firing has denounced Japan's spy satellite plan calling it a ``dangerous military action.''    The Radiopress agency in Tokyo monitoring North Korean reports said Korean Central Radio reported Tuesday that the scientists who worked on the launch were awarded medals.    When asked last week about recent reports of more possible North Korean missile tests U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen declined comment.  UR; yk-km
