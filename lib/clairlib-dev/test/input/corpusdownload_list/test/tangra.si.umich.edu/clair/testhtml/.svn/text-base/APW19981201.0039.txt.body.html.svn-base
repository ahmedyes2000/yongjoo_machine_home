<HTML>    TAIPEI Taiwan AP  Taiwanese police shot a Chinese fishermen in the leg after he and other crew members hurled dynamite at a Taiwanese patrol boat police said Tuesday.    Fisherman Lin Chuanshou 25 was in fair condition after being hospitalized with a bullet wound on the Taiwanese-held Matsu island group Matsu marine police chief Tsai Yu-chen said.    Four other crew members of the boat who dove overboard to avoid capture were rescued and being held at Military Police headquarters on Matsu Tsai said.    The crew had ignored a command from Taiwanese marine police to stop late Sunday night after the boat was reported exploding dynamite under the water to kill fish.    Crewmen threw five bundles of explosives at two Taiwanese boats when they approached missing each time said Tsai.    Taiwanese police towed the boat registered in the Fujian province port of Huangqi back to Matsu where they searched it and discovered 419 sticks of dynamite and 126 percussion caps aboard.    The five fishermen will likely be tried in Taiwan on charges of violating fishing laws. They will serve a prison sentence here if convicted before being sent home to the mainland Tsai said.    Tsai said his office receives frequent reports of dynamite fishing by Chinese boats which poses a severe danger to both the marine environment and other fishing boats.    The Matsu island group lies just 10 miles 6 kilometers off the coast of Fujian.
