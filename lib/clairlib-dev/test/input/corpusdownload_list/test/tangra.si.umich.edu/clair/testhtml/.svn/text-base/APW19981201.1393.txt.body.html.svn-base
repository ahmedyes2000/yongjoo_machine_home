<HTML>    CANBERRA Australia AP  Police issued a nationwide postal alert after finding 21 more parcel bombs at a Canberra mail processing center where a bomb exploded early Wednesday morning.    A postal worker was slightly injured by shrapnel when a package detonated. A search of the building found 21 more bombs.    Australian Federal Police said an identical parcel bomb was discovered in Sydney on Tuesday taking to 23 in all the number of bombs found so far.    The Sydney parcel was detonated by bomb squad police after the person to whom it was delivered became suspicious.    Federal Police Superintendent Geoff Hazel said the bomber targeted a specific segment of the community but he declined to identify them publicly for fear of compromising the investigation.    The parcels are white and similar in size to a computer disc storage box bearing a 2-dollar stamp and a 30-cent stamp.    pjs
