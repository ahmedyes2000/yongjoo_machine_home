<HTML>    CAPE TOWN South Africa AP  American business leaders believe corruption is the greatest obstacle to foreign investment in Africa U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley said Tuesday.    Daley delivered the assessment at an investment conference attended by hundreds of U.S. and southern African business executives and trade officials.    Daley said he had asked 15 American business leaders  including senior executives from Coca Cola Chevron DuPont and Eastman Kodak  who were accompanying him what the greatest obstacle to doing business in Africa was.    ``Eighty percent answered with one word: corruption'' Daley said attempting to explain why Africa accounts for only 1 percent of U.S. trade worldwide even though the continent has a population of 800 million.    Daley's trip to Africa comes eight months after U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Africa  a trip Clinton had hoped would mark ``the beginning of a new African renaissance.''    The war in mineral-rich Congo however represents an enormous setback to that vision Daley said. The war between rebels fighting President Laurent Kabila's government began in August and involves troops from at least five other countries.  UR; ``The fighting 7th graf pvs    aos/djw
