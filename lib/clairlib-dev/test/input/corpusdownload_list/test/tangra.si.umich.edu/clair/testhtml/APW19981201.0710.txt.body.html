<HTML>    JERUSALEM AP  Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Tuesday that Greece turned down his invitation to carry out a joint operation in the Mediterranean after Israel and Turkey held similar exercises in the area.    Turkey is Greece's traditional rival and Greece has been watching the growing Israeli-Turkish military alliance with some concern.    ``We invited them to a humanitarian exercise at sea more than a year ago and they refused'' Mordechai said according to his spokesman Avi Benayahu.    ``They were invited once again to hold such an exercise'' while the Greek air force commander Lt. Gen. Giorgos Antonetzis visited Israel on Tuesdayu Benayahu said. Benayahu did not say how the Greek visitor responded.    Turkey and Greece remain at odds over Cyprus divided since Turkish forces invaded its northern third to protect the Turkish minority after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece in 1974.    Mordechai said he supported a diplomatic solution to the Cyprus conflict.    The Greek air force already has several defense contracts with Israel including the maintenance of F-16 fighter planes.
