<HTML>    KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia AP  A key police witness in the Anwar Ibrahim trial told the court Tuesday that he had failed to win business favors from the ex-deputy prime minister but denied that led him to testify against the defendant.    The former police intelligence officer Amir Junos faced questioning from defense attorneys about whether he was biased against Anwar because his request for favors had been denied.    Earlier the witness had admitted during cross-examination that he had asked Anwar for equity in a securities firm and business deals for his friends.    ``I was not given anything. I merely tried to express my feeling to get a portion of the equity but I did not get anything'' Amir told the court.    Defense lawyer Christopher Fernando suggested Amir might bear a grudge after having failed to get the equity stake in the brokerage. ``I do not have such intentions'' Amir replied.    Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 two weeks after he was fired as Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister. His subsequent jailing and beating while in custody have attracted international concern over the case.    Anwar is being tried on four counts of corruption. He will be tried on another corruption count as well as five counts of sexual misconduct at a later date.    The former deputy premier denies the charges calling them part of political vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.    Amir was called as a witness by the prosecution to prove allegations that Anwar had directed the police to harass and intimidate two people who had alleged that Anwar had sex with his secretary's wife and had sodomized his chauffeur.    The case has been buffeted by raucous proceedings including the sentencing on Monday of one of the defense lawyers to three months in jail for contempt of court. The action against defense lawyer Zainur Zakaria interrupted the main trial when the defense team asked for an adjournment to recover from the blow.    Judge Augustine Paul handed down the sentence Monday after Zainur refused to apologize for an affidavit he had filed on behalf of Anwar seeking the removal of two prosecutors on grounds that they were allegedly fabricating evidence.    The lawyer who won a reprieve from a higher court that stayed his imprisonment pending an appeal hearing this coming Friday was present in the court Tuesday.    During his testimony Tuesday witness Amir also denied warning Anwar about ``political enemies'' or telling the former No. 2 in the government that his phone had been tapped since 1992.
