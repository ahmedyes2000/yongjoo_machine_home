<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  The Russian government on Tuesday dismissed allegations that its secret services provoked a recent confrontation between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan two ex-Soviet republics in Central Asia.    ``Any claims about the Russian secret services involvement in the exacerbation of the Uzbek-Tajik relations are absolutely groundless'' the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.    Uzbek President Islam Karimov on Monday accused the Russian Federal Security Service FSB the main successor of the KGB of provoking a recent dispute between his nation and neighboring Tajikistan.    The dispute centered on an anti-government rebellion last month in Tajikistan which was put down after several days of fierce fighting that claimed 334 lives.    Tajik authorities accused Uzbekistan of helping train the rebels commanded by former Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev and harboring them after their defeat. Uzbekistan has angrily denied the claims.    Karimov claimed an FSB officer an ethnic Tajik fomented the uprising. The FSB acknowledged the officer Rizo Tursunov is an agent but said he had no role in the incident.    Tajikistan an impoverished nation reeling from several years of civil war has been plagued by frequent clashes despite a peace deal signed last year by the Russian-backed hardline government and the mostly Islamic opposition.    ``Our efforts are aimed at consistent support of national reconciliation and ensuring peace process in Tajikistan'' the Russian foreign ministry said. ``Russia isn't pursuing any other interests in the region.''    vi/ren
