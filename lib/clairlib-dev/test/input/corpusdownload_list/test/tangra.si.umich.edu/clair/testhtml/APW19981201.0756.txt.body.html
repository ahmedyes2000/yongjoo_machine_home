<HTML>    STOCKHOLM Sweden AP  Share and share alike. That seems to be the current fad for staging international soccer finals.    Belgium and the Netherlands will co-host the 2000 European Championship while South Korea and Japan will share the 2002 World Cup finals.    Now Sweden Denmark Finland and Norway plan a joint application for the 2008 European Championship.    Officials from the four national soccer federations have drawn up plans for a joint application although the deadline for the application is still far off  sometime in mid-2002.    In 1997 Sweden and Norway organized the women's World Cup soccer finals.    The Swedish soccer federation's secretary-general Lars-Christer Olsson has been assigned to draw up a report on how to harmonize tax regulations for the finals.    ``We are counting on the same concept of 16 teams in the finals'' Swedish federation spokesman Goran Havik said.    That would imply one group in each country and quarterfinals in each country.    The semifinals would likely be played in Finland and Norway.    The final would be played in the Swedish west coast city of Goteborg at Ullevi Stadium which hosted the 1992 European Championship soccer final and the 1995 Track and Field World Championships.    ``It is the largest arena seating 43000 and Goteborg is used to big events'' Havik said.    The site for the 2004 European Championship will be selected by UEFA in June. Hungary and Austria have entered a joint bid with Spain and Portugal also in the running.    ls/sw
