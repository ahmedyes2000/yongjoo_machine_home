<HTML>    MUNICH Germany AP  Bundesliga leader Bayern Munich shrugged off freezing weather and reached the semifinals of the German Cup by routing crisis-shaken Stuttgart 3-0 on Tuesday.    Carsten Jancker used a good pass from veteran Lothar Matthaeus in the 26th minute to open the scoring.    A looping shot from 20 meters yards by international midfielder Mario Basler made it 2-0 and substitute Alexander Zickler scored the third in the 79th after a fast break.    A small crowd of 11000 braved the freezing temperature to see the match in the Olympic stadium.    The defeat could spell the end of coach Winfried Schaefer's reign in Stuttgart which is now without a win in six games with four defeats and two losses.    Some German media reports say Stuttgart players are rebelling against the unpopular coach who is also detested by fans.    Schaefer dropped Bulgarian star midfielder Krasimir Balakov from the rosters while starting striker Fredi Bobic only came on in the second halftime.    ns
