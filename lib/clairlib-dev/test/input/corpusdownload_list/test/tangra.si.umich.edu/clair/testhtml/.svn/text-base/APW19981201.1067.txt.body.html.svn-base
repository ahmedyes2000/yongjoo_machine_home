<HTML>    Demonstrators chanted ``We want justice'' as the ambulance went past. Chilean diplomatic vehicles followed with armed police at the rear.    There was no immediate word on where Pinochet was headed. Supporters have been looking for a house where he can wait in comfort to learn whether the British government will agree to extradition.    There was speculation he would head to a nine-bedroom home on a luxurious estate in Surrey near the Wentworth Golf Club home of the European golf tour about 20 miles 30 kms west of central London.    If Home Secretary Jack Straw who must rule by Dec. 11 allows extradition proceedings to begin Pinochet will likely be in Britain for months fighting his case through the courts.    Wherever he stays his neighbors face disruption. Chilean exiles mount demonstrations and there is a police guard and heavy police presence.    Earlier his lawyer said Pinochet was distressed by the hospital's demand for him to leave. He had planned to move on Monday but the arrangement fell through because of ``unforeseen practical difficulties'' said lawyer Michael Caplan.    Adding to Pinochet's troubles an opinion poll published Tuesday indicated that a narrow majority  51 percent  of Britons think Pinochet should be extradited.    The National Opinion poll published in London's Evening Standard said 32 percent of a 961-strong sample of voters questioned nationwide wanted him sent home and the rest had no opinion. The error margin was plus or minus three percent.    A Chilean government report says some 3000 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's 1970-93 rule.    But Chile is trying to get him back because of fears that the anger of his supporters may destabilize its democracy.    Chile's foreign minister Jose Miguel Insulza was in Spain Tuesday after lobbying British officials arguing that Pinochet may be tried in Chile if he is freed.    mj
