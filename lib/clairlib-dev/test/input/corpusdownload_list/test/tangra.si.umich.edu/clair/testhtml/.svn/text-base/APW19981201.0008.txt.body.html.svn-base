<HTML>    SINGAPORE AP  The British-American Tobacco Company said Tuesday its Singapore subsidiary will halt all manufacturing because of a significant drop in local and global demand.    The Singapore facility  which produces tobacco products for domestic and export markets  was no longer viable and its closure will result in significant cost savings said a statement from BAT.    The plant will cease all manufacturing operations by June 1999 and more than 300 employees will be laid off.    The London-based company says its non-manufacturing activities which include the import and sale of tobacco products in Singapore will not be affected by the closure.    British-American Tobacco Company said the cost of winding the plant down will likely result in a loss for the financial year ending Dec. 31 but the company is optimistic about future prospects for the streamlined business.
