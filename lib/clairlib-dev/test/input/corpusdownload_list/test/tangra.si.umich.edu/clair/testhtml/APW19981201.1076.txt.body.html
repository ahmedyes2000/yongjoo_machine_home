<HTML>    MILAN Italy AP  Italy will use the same trio of players who upset the United States when it takes on defending champion Sweden in this weekend's Davis Cup final at Assago Forum.    Italian captain Paolo Bertolucci announced Tuesday that Andrea Gaudenzi and Davide Sanguinetti will play the singles with Diego Nargiso teaming with Gaudenzi in the doubles.    Gianluca Pozzi will be along as a reserve.    ``You can't change a winning team'' Bartolucci said.    Italy's top-ranked player Gaudenzi and Sanguinetti and Nargiso routed a Sampras- and Agassi-less United States 4-1 in the semifinals at Milwaukee.    Meanwhile Thomas Johansson who has been nursing a strained right knee may become a last-minute starter for Sweden in the three-day best-of-5 indoor final on clay on the outskirts of Milan.    Johansson initially dropped from the Swedish team because of the knee and his questionable results on clay trained at the Forum this week showing good form.    Johansson may replace Magnus Norman on Sweden's quartet.    Swedish captain Carl-Axel Hageskog said he will announce his team on Thursday  the day of the official draw in Milan  and declined to comment on Johansson's chances.    Johansson is the highest-ranked Swedish player in the ATP Tour computer at 17th.    Sweden enters the final as favorite to clinch its seventh title and third in four years.    However Hageskog noted Italy may have the advantage playing on clay.    ``Otherwise I'm not worried with the home crowd. My players are able to negotiate every situation'' he said.
