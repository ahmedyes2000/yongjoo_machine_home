<HTML>    TOKYO AP  The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Tuesday in Tokyo following an overnight decline on Wall Street. Japanese stocks finished the day's trading lower.

In mid-afternoon trading the U.S. dollar bought 122.88 yen down 0.94 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 123.26 yen overnight.    The dollar's weakness was largely because of the overnight fall in U.S. stocks traders said. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9116.55 on Monday down 216.53 points or 2.3 percent.    ``The margin of fall in the Dow was quite big. That has muted the bullish sentiment over the U.S. economy and the dollar somewhat'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto senior manager of the treasury and funding department of Sanwa Bank.    Among those selling the dollar were U.S. hedge funds and Japanese institutional investors traders said.

JDC later confirmed that it filed for protection with the Tokyo District Court Tuesday morning with debts totaling 406.7 billion yen dlrs 3.33 billion from failed golf course and other projects.
