<HTML>    BAGHDAD Iraq AP  The United Nations has brought its complement of 120 weapons inspectors in Iraq up to full strength a U.N. official said Tuesday.    The inspectors are ready to resume the intrusive searches of suspected arms sites that the Iraqi authorities tried to halt on Aug. 5 when they refused to provide the necessary escorts.    ``We are back at full strength as we were before the latest crisis and we are ready to carry out all inspections'' the spokeswoman for the U.N. inspectors Caroline Cross said in Baghdad.    The United Nations evacuated its weapons experts on Nov. 11 as the United States and Britain prepared to launch air strikes to force Iraq to reverse its Oct. 31 decision to cease all cooperation with the inspectors.    Iraq relented Nov. 14 and inspectors began returning to Baghdad three days later. The first batches of inspectors to return have been checking monitoring equipment installed at sites where Iraq previously worked on its program of missiles and weapons of mass destruction.    But lately the United Nations has been flying in visiting teams of inspectors whose mission is to search sites where Iraq is suspected of hiding evidence of its banned weapons program. It is these inspections that have previously brought Iraq and the United Nations to the brink of a showdown.    ``We expect to see more visiting teams and we will be real busy for the next few weeks'' Cross told The Associated Press.
