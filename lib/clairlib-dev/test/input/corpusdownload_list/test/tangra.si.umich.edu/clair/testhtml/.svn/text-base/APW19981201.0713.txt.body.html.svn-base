<HTML>    DUBAI United Arab Emirates AP  The United Arab Emirates is allowing entry to foreigners who have visited Israel an immigration official said Tuesday.    The Emirates began permitting foreigners with Israeli visa stamps in their passports to enter the country about three months ago under orders from the Interior Ministry the official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.    Most Arab countries including the United Arab Emirates do not have diplomatic relations with Israel and for years did not allow entry to anyone who had visited the Jewish state.    In recent years Oman and Qatar established low-level trade relations with Israel and began allowing Israelis  as well as foreigners with Israeli visa stamps  to enter.    Kuwait allows British U.S. and French citizens to enter if they have Israeli visas in their passports and evaluates others on a case-by-case basis an immigration official at the airport said.    The other Arab Gulf states  Bahrain and Saudi Arabia  ban entry to anyone with an Israeli visa stamp.    Egypt and Jordan which have peace treaties with Israel and some North African nations also allow Israeli visitors as well as foreigners who have visited the Jewish state.
