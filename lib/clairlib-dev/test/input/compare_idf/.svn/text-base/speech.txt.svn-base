 mr presid the senat and hous will soon vote on the presid find that withhold disburs of usaid famili plan fund until juli 1 1997 will caus seriou damag to the proper function of the program
 it i no surpris that the presid reach thi conclus it i beyond disput that famili plan servic includ the provis of modern contracept ar the most effect wai to prevent unwant pregnanc and abort the exampl that the presid cite to support hi find should be read by everi member of congress thei illustr the harm these restrict have alreadi done to the program and the further harm measur in the number of women who will die from unsaf abort that could be prevent and children who will die from diseas or starvat becaus their famili could not care for them a well a in ad administr cost that a further delai in disburs will caus thei also refut the flagrantli erron claim of the right-to-lif lobbi that thi vote i about whether or not to provid $123 million to organ that fund abort not on dime of these fund can be us for abort and the vote i onli about when not whether these fund will be disburs
 i will have more to sai about thi at the time of the vote but i want to be sure that all senat saw the editori from thi saturdai washington post and thi sundai post op- piec by david broder which make compel argument for uphold the presid find perhap most noteworthi i the quot from former senat hatfield who wa staunchli pro-lif but an equal strong support of famili plan he said it i a proven fact that when contracept servic ar not avail to women throughout the world abort rate increas
 mr presid that should be the begin and end of thi debat i ask unanim consent that the two articl be print in the record
 i suggest the absenc of a quorum equal divid
 mr presid there ar sever peopl on thi side of thi issu who will speak and so i will be brief to retain time for them and i will yield myself now such time a i need
 all senat should understand what thi vote i it i realli whether to approv the presid find the presid find i that withhold until juli 1 the releas of the fund that congress appropri last septemb for intern famili plan would result in more unwant pregnanc and abort and harm program to protect the health of women and children
 thi i not whether you ar for abort or against abort whether you ar for famili plan or against it we know in mani part of the world famili plan i abort becaus we do not have everyth from birth control devic to train so peopl reli on abort what thi would do would realli give altern to it in a misguid effort by some foe of abort last year the fund were held up until now and if anyth will result in more abort not less
 what i would like to see u do i releas the fund for famili plan and give peopl an altern to abort a a form of famili plan in fact 2 week ago the hous vote by a substanti margin to uphold the presid find that meant that republican and democrat vote to uphold the presid find and the senat i go to vote tomorrow
 some sai that approv the presid find would result in spend an addit $123 million on abort of cours that i fals total patent fals thi vote will not chang the amount spent on famili plan by on dime and none of thi monei can be spent on abort or to promot abort our law prohibit that
 thi i an extrem import vote and there should be no confus about what it i about so let me first talk about what thi i not so all senat no matter on which side of the abort issu he or she i will understand why thei can support thi resolut thi vote i not about how much we ar go to spend on intern famili plan we alreadi decid that we decid that i believ last septemb when we pass the foreign aid bill that bill contain $385 million for famili plan and if we pass thi resolut that amount i not go to chang at all if the resolut i defeat the amount still will not chang so nobodi should think we ar vote to add or take awai monei
 the vote will also not affect how we spend the $385 million it will not affect for instanc which famili plan organ receiv the fund so no matter which wai we vote todai we do not determin which group receiv the fund it doe not affect that nor will thi vote decid in ani wai no matter which wai we vote if the fund can be us for abort or to promot abort
 thi vote will decid onli on thing all thi vote decid i what date do we start spend the $385 million that we appropri last year in the last congress it doe not decid whether to spend it or how to spend it or what to spend it on onli whether we start spend the fund on juli 1 9 month after the start of the fiscal year or march 1 5 month after the start of the fiscal year
 you mai ask what differ doe 4 month make march 1 juli 1 so what if it did not make ani differ we would not even be here but the differ i there ar ten of million of peopl who will not have access to famili plan servic dure those 4 month we ar talk about modern contracept a well a condom that protect against aid thi vote i about whether we should withhold famili plan servic to coupl who desper want to limit the size of their famili or space the birth of their children so their children surviv past infanc
 we ar not talk about monei in a wealthi countri like the unit state we ar talk about monei in the poorest of poor countri we ar talk about monei so peopl might be abl to space their children so thei do not see what so mani of these countri do children that die in the first year in fact a number of these countri do not even list a birth until the child i sever month old or even year old becaus of the high number of infant death
 there i no more effect practic wai to reduc the number of abort than famili plan i could cite mani exampl here i on befor 1990 a russian woman averag at least three abort in her lifetim from 1990 to 1994 with support from usaid contracept us in russia grew from 19 to about 24 percent just that 5-percent increas in the us of contracept result in a decreas in the number of abort dure that period by 800,000 abort
 i would ask how mani of those who oppos that famili plan monei back dure those year becaus somehow it might be us for abort how mani of them ar will to stand up and sai becaus we spent it we stop 800,000 abort in on countri alon that should be the begin and the end of thi
 debat if you ar against abort and a number of senat on thi floor have vote for famili plan monei becaus and primarili becaus thei ar oppos to abort becaus thei know thi provid altern to abort just a we prove it did in russia just that 6 percent increas in contracept us cut the number of abort by 800,000
 i ask unanim consent a letter from senat mark hatfield to repres chri smith be print in the record at end of my remark
 i mention thi becaus senat hatfield wa ardent consist pro-lif for all hi year here in the senat but i also know he i equal passion about hi support for famili plan he fulli understood that when you limit access to famili plan the result i more abort
 the other side will argu that sinc a tini fraction of these fund mai go to privat organ that provid abort in countri like the unit state where abort i legal the resolut should be defeat there i no logic in that what if the tabl were turn and i argu that no famili plan organ should receiv u govern fund unless thei do us their own fund for abort there would be a big outcri it big govern how dare you tell these privat group what to do with their monei that i not a road we want to go down aid requir everi dime to be kept in a separ account we know how everi dime of our monei i spent there ha never been ani evid that ani of these fund have been us for abort if there were you can be sure we would have heard about it
 so let u start spend the monei that we appropri 5 month ago so it can do some good the longer we wait the more we add to the cost of administ the program the more damag we caus to the health of women and children the more unwant pregnanc and abort will result it i that simpl
 i would also sai thi ha becom more of a polit argument than an argument base on realiti i do not hear ani of the advoc of thi posit of withhold thi monei stand up and sai let not send ani of our foreign aid to ani countri that mai us some of their monei their monei in that countri to pai for abort i challeng those who oppos thi resolut if you want to prove that you ar realli sincer if you want to prove you ar not do thi becaus of some other agenda then pass a law that sai that no monei none of our foreign aid monei can go to ani countri that us ani of it monei for abort that make no more sens than vote against thi resolut
 mr presid i retain the remaind of my time
 mr presid the distinguish senat from wisconsin i on the floor how much time doe he wish
 i yield 8 minut to the distinguish senat from wisconsin
 if you would like
 mr presid i know the distinguish senior senat from main wish to speak and i yield to her such time a she mai requir
 mr presid i want to commend the senior senat from main for her statement it demonstr a we have said befor that thi i not a partisan issu thi i an issu of good sens whether peopl believ that abort should be legal or whether peopl believ there should not be abort it make no differ we should be try to join togeth in thi to avoid all abort if you have famili plan that to me i a far greater altern than us abort a famili plan
 a we also show in thi in russia where just increas our foreign aid over a rel short period of time and increas the avail of contracept by about 5 percent that cut out 800,000 abort i mean the fact of the matter i if we hold the monei back for famili plan abort go up if we releas the monei for famili plan abort go down hold back the monei just becaus it mai make some feel like thei ar be a purist on the abort issu fli in the face of realiti it i rhetor over realiti the realiti i spend monei for famili plan and you reduc abort
 i see the distinguish senior senat from massachusett i yield to him
 the distinguish senat from vermont i on the floor how much time doe he need
 i yield 3 minut
 mr presid i yield to the distinguish senat from oregon such time a he mai desir
 mr presid reserv the right to object and i tell the distinguish major whip that i will object and explain why i understand that there ar peopl who wish to be consult i believ on both side of the aisl on thi therefor i do object and suggest perhap we could run a hotlin on both side we mai be abl to work out a time agreement
 how much time i remain to the senat from vermont
 madam presid i will take on moment for myself and then yield to the senat from california
 i will note for my colleagu that we ar here becaus of an agreement enter into in good faith by republican and democrat by those who support the monei for famili plan and those who oppos it last year unfortun like in the hous we have a request for anoth vote becaus some of the peopl who made that agreement last year do not now want to live up to it
 i have spent 22 year in the senat if i give my word on someth if i make an agreement on someth i carri it out i am surpris that there have been some in the other bodi and elsewher who ar not will to honor the spirit of an agreement made
 i mention thi onli becaus there ar aspect to thi agreement that i wa not happi with and there ar other vote i would have like to have had but the agreement wa that both side would have thi vote and that would be it
 when i came here 22 year ago the distinguish major leader senat mansfield and the distinguish republican leader senat scott said the same thing to everi member of the senat whatev you do here keep your word
 senat i have dealt with on thi issu have i am concern some in the other bodi have not and it i unfortun
 i note that contrari to what some on the other side have said thi afternoon thi vote i not about the earli releas of famili plan fund if we approv thi resolut it still mean the
 fund ar go to be 5 month late
 it ha been said that thi vote will provid $123 million more to organ that fund abort that i total fals thi vote will not increas or decreas the amount we appropri last year at all
 it i said thi vote will increas from $356 million to $385 million the fund for famili plan ye but that i a $130 million cut from 2 year ago
 we also agre what thi vote would be about and what it would not be about
 and we heard that thi i about fund abort of cours not if anyth the fact show that where we have given monei to provid famili plan the number of abort have gone down not up and gone down veri substanti and when we withheld the monei for famili plan abort have gone up
 i yield to the senat from california 8 minut
 how much time i remain for the senat from vermont
 madam presid with the except of a few self-appoint expert who have appar never been to beij mexico citi or calcutta it i wide understood that stabil the earth popul i the foremost challeng of our time
 thi vote i a import a ani vote we ar go to cast thi year but i do not think we should confus with someth it i not there ar other vote for or against abort but a the distinguish senat from california ha said that i not what thi vote i there seem to be no end to the number of time we will fight the fight on abort but that i not what thi vote i about despit what some would try to suggest
 thi vote i about a program that i absolut crucial if we ar go to stabil the earth popul in the 21st centuri the number of peopl born in the next decad ar go to decid that question
 a quarter of the earth peopl live in poverti thei have no job thei have noth resembl adequ shelter and medic
 care thei drink from the stream thei and their anim bath in thei live from hand to mouth in filth and in despair we can do someth to help
 our famili plan program give those peopl a chanc to get out from under the crush weight of more and more hungri mouth to feed some argu that by give them that chanc we impos our valu on them the peopl who make that argument should ask those peopl a i have thei should ask them if thei feel we ar impos our valu on them what thei will hear a i have i that there ar hundr of million of coupl who want access to famili plan and cannot get it or cannot afford it thei desper want to be abl to decid when to have children and how mani to have thei do not see that a u impos our will on them but give them the chanc to make their own decis then thei will decid
 the onli question i whether thei will decid with famili plan or with abort or by have more children who die in infanc of hunger and diseas if we ask those peopl if thei want to have the technologi and the knowledg so thei can make the choic of when to have children and how mani to have or if thei would rather reli on abort or have more children who will die of diseas or hunger the answer i veri simpl thei want control over their own live and by pass thi resolut a the hous did 2 week ago we give those peopl safe altern to abort now not 4 month from now when for mani of them it will alreadi be too late
 madam presid it i the height of arrog for u to stand on thi floor and sai becaus of a few single-issu group in the unit state we will not give famili in other countri the chanc to make the decis that ani on of u could do in our own famili or in our children famili becaus we live in a nation where famili plan i readili avail and all of u make the kind of incom where it i not a problem for u
 but we stand here and sai so somebodi can put a notch on the wall that thei vote polit correctli for which single-issu group or some fundrais letter ha gone out and we turn our back on million of peopl who want our help
 again i would remind my colleagu of the fact in the record here in 4 year time in russia where we made avail famili plan servic where we increas just on simpl thing the us of contracept by just 4 or 5 percent the number of abort went down by 800,000
 but some of the same peopl stand on the floor of the senat todai and the floor of the hous and sai that thei ar against provid these servic becaus somehow thei ar follow a right-to-lif or antiabort agenda and thei vote against the monei that wa us in russia and that same monei help reduc the number of abort by 800,000
 we have member in thi bodi and the other bodi who sai thei have to be so depend on single-issu group that thei cannot vote for thi monei thei cannot vote for thi monei becaus somebodi somewher in that countri some privat organ might us monei of their own not our for abort so we should not give them ani monei for famili plan fortun a major of the hous wa wise enough to stand up to the single-issu group and vote for thi resolut
 let u stop the hypocrisi and stop the pander to single-issu group i do not care whether thei ar to the right or to the left let u do what i right how can we stand here and sai oh we can do thi becaus we'r rich and we know better but boi we'r go to show you we can't help you becaus somewher somebodi will send out newslett to somebodi will sai thei didn't stick to the agenda that our group ask them to do let u stop the hypocrisi and do what i right
 and let vote for thi resolut
 i ask unanim consent a letter by the distinguish secretari of state madelein albright be print in the record
 madam presid the distinguish senat from kentucki and i discuss earlier i ask unanim consent understand of cours that i will yield immedi to the senat from kentucki if he or hi repres come to the floor that i be allow to continu without the time go beyond the time we would begin the byrd amend at 3:30
 madam presid it i so frustrat everi year we have thi debat time after time we have written into our law that not on cent of our monei for famili plan can be us for abort and none of it ha been yet we hear the argument but we can't send monei to some privat group becaus thei mai us some of their monei for abort we do not hear anybodi stand on the floor and sai we cannot send foreign aid to thi or that govern becaus thei mai us some of their monei for abort that i never done nor will it ever be done nor should it be done but it point out the illog of their argument
 thi ha becom a litmu test vote for some pressur group in thi countri the same pressur group ar wise enough to not to advoc withhold foreign aid from govern that allow legal abort or that us their fund for abort i am not suggest that nor have i heard anybodi suggest that howev the hypocrisi i obviou
 let u not legisl for single-issu group on the right or the left democrat or republican conserv or liber let u instead legisl what i in the best interest of the countri now mayb we will offend the right on dai and the next dai the left mayb we will offend thi single-issu group on dai and that single-issu group the next dai mayb we will upset somebodi special-interest newslett thi dai and somebodi els the next dai but do you know what madam presid in the long run the american peopl will be far more respect of the u senat if we do that
 on thi issu it i veri simpl we have alreadi appropri the monei what we ar do now i withhold the monei so that it cannot be spent a long a it i not spent instead of peopl have access to famili plan instead of peopl be abl to make the decis themselv of how mani children thei will have and when the number of abort will start go up again a we have shown over and over again when famili plan i avail the number of abort go down and when famili plan withheld the number of abort go up it wa that wai long befor ani on of u serv in thi bodi it will be that wai long after we leav
 so we should stop the rhetor for the fundrais letter but instead do what i right we want to help countri determin what thei mai or mai not do on the question of overpopul on the us of their own resourc be given not the tool of abort but the tool of famili plan and tell the special interest group that sai no that mayb thei have gone a bit too far
 i have noth but respect for my colleagu who ar oppos to abort i wish there would never be anoth abort in thi world but i am also a realist enough to know that simpli withhold famili plan monei or pass law doe not stop abort give peopl altern to abort modern contracept that doe cut down on abort
 a i sai i have noth but the greatest respect for those who have moral opposit to abort but we should be realist it i like the old dai when we pass law against abort and the back-room abortionist thrive a thei did in my state when abort wa legal peopl made the choic
 thi i not necessarili directli on point in thi debat but i rememb and i remind peopl who think simpli pass a law determin what i a veri difficult question for ani woman to ask what happen in my state in dai when i wa a young prosecutor i got a call at 3 o'clock on morn to go to our medic center
 where a young woman lai nearli dy hemorrhag from an illeg abort a part of the investig i institut that 3 am in the morn we found out that a number of women some colleg student had gone to on person in our commun to seek abort he would arrang illeg abort for them abort were perform by a man who had learn how to perform abort while work for the ss at auschwitz the women would be sent to canada the abort would be perform thei were basic the darn needl type of abort and subsequ he would blackmail these women for monei or sex thei had no other place to go thi i where thei went thi on young woman nearli di did not die but end up steril a a result if she had not nearli di i never would have found out about it thi man would never have been prosecut i prosecut him a a result of that we end up with anoth case which i wa veri proud of call leahi versu beecham a predecessor to roe versu wade which made clear that abort within a medic context would be legal then the difficult question that ani woman would have to
 make would be her decis whatev consequ would be her not the manipul of a back-room abortionist
 in a wai we do almost the same thing here we sai we will withhold safe and legal altern to abort famili plan becaus we ar against abort the abort will go up abort will go up and peopl will die instead we should give famili from the largess of the unit state monei to plan their famili
 madam presid i yield back all time on both side
 madam presid i suggest the absenc of a quorum
 mr presid we should understand what we ar vote on we ar about to vote on a resolut to decid when not whether we releas fund but when
 somebodi said yesterdai that thi vote i about an addit $123 million for group that fund abort that i absolut fals we have appropri thi monei there i no addit monei in fact we ar vote to spend and releas $160 million less than we appropri 2 year ago so whether or not thi resolut pass thi afternoon the fund ar go to be spent anywai it i just a question of when
 we should also understand that u law which all of u have support sai that none of thi monei can be us to pai for abort anywher and veri care audit have been made of thi monei and nobodi ha shown that a cent of it ha ever been us to promot abort
 some sai we will have anoth popul fund vote mayb later thi week that i not go to happen thi i the onli vote on famili plan do we vote to releas the monei now that i march 1 or juli 1 that i all it i but if we delai we ar us the ultim arrog we ar sai we know better than you you cannot have famili plan monei
 let me tell you what happen when we spend it in russia abort wa routin us a a method for famili plan in the 4 year sinc we start famili plan program there just by increas the number of contracept by 5 percent the number of abort fell 800,000 so when we put famili plan monei into russia abort came down by 800,000 when we withhold famili plan monei abort then go up we ought to ask ourselv about that
 the senat from main senat snow spoke so eloqu on thi senat gordon smith who i veri much a right-to-lif senat spoke of hi opposit to abort but of hi support of famili plan
 we should listen to what i realli here we ar just sai let u stop abort by vote for famili plan
 mr presid i move to reconsid the vote by which the joint resolut wa pass
 mr presid i hope we can complet these foreign aid bill i would also sai to my friend from mississippi he mention whether we should us taxpay monei for abort in the foreign aid bill there i a specif prohibit against ani u dollar be us for abort abroad in the foreign aid bill
 in fact a senat mark hatfield former chairman of the appropri committe and i point out on the floor earlier he wa veri much a right-to-lif antiabort senat consist in that point out that the famili plan monei that have gone in the foreign aid bill have dramat decreas the number of abort in those area where thei were us
 an exampl wa russia where abort wa us a a form of birth control where we gave them famili plan monei and the number of abort drop dramat
 so i hope that we will continu to do that and realiz while famili plan i someth avail to most peopl in the unit state in a lot of other countri it i not avail becaus of cost becaus of techniqu becaus of train for whatev reason unfortun in those countri ofttim abort ar a mean of famili plan so i hope that those who ar against abort would realiz famili plan monei can help u prevent that
 mr presid i ask unanim consent that the order for the quorum call be rescind
 mr presid can the chair advis the senat from vermont where we ar on the time
 the presid offic the senat from delawar us 50 minut of the 3 hour in consequ to hi side there ar 2 hour 10 minut remain
 ye
 thank you mr presid i assur my friend from delawar i will not util all that time i yield myself such time a i requir within those constraint
 mr presid when the senat pass it version of the state author bill last year it contain no refer at all to intern famili plan or the mexico citi polici which a we know restrict u govern fund to privat famili plan organ the reason for that wa obviou famili plan ha noth to do with the state author bill
 thi bill i about how mani assist secretari of state there will be the bureau how thei ar set up and so on it i not about run plan parenthood
 the hous saw thing differ unfortun a minor in the hous saw yet anoth opportun to hold hostag import foreign polici legisl and thei did like fund for the unit nation and the reorgan of the state depart in do so thei sought to forc the presid to embrac a discredit famili plan polici he ha repeatedli and publicli reject
 for some reason the hous seem to think that send it down to the white hous to get a certain veto repres some kind of victori when all it doe i guarante that we will revisit thi issu again and again and again
 when i came to the senat we had member of both parti who tri to repres the unit state in the best wai possibl thei would join in a bipartisan agreement on foreign polici to act in wai that would make the unit state a strong a possibl
 somehow in the past few year we have some who seek to make polit point or fill out form on fundrais letter or whatev and thei distort the foreign polici of the unit state for their own short-term polit gain it i almost a though with their ego thei feel that whatev their issu i all that matter and the foreign polici of the unit state can be thrown overboard thei ar go to make their point thei ar go to send out their fundrais letter thei ar go to recruit their support base on how thei might distort the foreign polici of the unit state and thei could care less of the consequ i will give you an exampl
 an agreement wa reach last year with the republican leadership and the democrat leadership of the hous and the senat and the presid of the unit state that we would pai the due that we ow under law and under treati and under agreement to the unit nation it i monei we agre to pai ar legal oblig to pai and have not paid
 then on the veri dai that the unit state wa ask the secur council of the unit nation to stand solidli with u on the question of sanction on iraq on the veri dai that the unit state wa ask a dispar group in the secur council to agre with u against saddam hussein and hi refus to compli with hi oblig under the secur council resolut on that same dai the republican leadership of the hous of repres broke it word broke it word to the presid broke it word to the unit nation broke it word to the american peopl broke it word to the congress and kill the bill to pai our due to the unit nation
 and why becaus a hand of peopl in the hous of repres want to includ the so-cal mexico citi languag that did not have the support of even a major of the senat not to mention enough vote to overrid a veto and which the presid had made unequivoc clear he would veto
 the u congress should have the honesti and the matur to put the interest of the countri ahead of the individu polit interest of member we ar ask to do thi often a we should be there ha to be some reason for serv here other than send out fundrais letter or make polit point mayb it seem novel to some but i come from the old school and we vermont feel that the countri come first
 mr presid it would be on thing if the onli problem with the mexico citi polici were that it i total nongerman to thi bill which it i but it i a lot wors than that it i anti-famili plan anti-fre speech anti-women anti-children and fli in the face of the veri democrat principl we ar encourag other countri to adopt it i among the most illog and misguid approach to an issu i have seen in my time here
 what the hous ha done i send u a confer report that we have no opportun to amend which contain a controversi provis that wa not in the senat version that wa never vote on by the senat that i certain to be veto and which despit repeat attempt ha not won a major of vote in the senat for over a decad
 mr presid we could simpli voic vote thi confer report and let the presid veto it but that would resolv noth sinc the propon of the mexico citi polici would simpli plai the same game with the imf supplement and if that fail with the other appropri bill i am wait for them to put it on a bill deal with highwai or nation forest or agricultur research or some other thing the rule ar irrelev to them logic i irrelev to them good sens i irrelev to them and the interest of the countri ar appar irrelev
 the onli wai we ar go to put a stop to these antic i for the senat to reject the mexico citi polici altogeth for the senat to stand up and sai we will not plai these game we will be the nation conscienc
 i am among those who believ we should pai our debt to the unit nation if the unit state give it word that it i go to do someth then we should do it we bring our children up that wai we tell them if thei give their word thei ought to keep their word well we ar the on who ar the keeper of the word of the unit state when the unit state give it word we ought to be honest enough to back it up
 the unit nation i help solv global problem that we could not possibli solv by ourselv even though thei ar problem that affect the unit state of america unfortun the amount author here fall far short of what we ow and it i encumb with too mani restrict
 other includ the distinguish chairman of the foreign relat committe want to reorgan the state depart but if we pass thi confer report with the mexico citi languag there will be no state reorgan becaus it will be veto and it will be held hostag by the hous indefinit
 so the senat from vermont believ there i onli on option defeat it and send it back to the hous there ar no guarante but that i our best hope of get the mexico citi polici stricken from thi bill so the presid can sign it
 befor i discuss what thi version of the mexico citi polici would do let me remind all senat what should be common knowledg unit state law explicitli prohibit the us of u govern fund to pai for abort or to lobbi for abort that ha been the law for year you wouldn't know it to hear some of the propon of the mexico citi polici talk but that i the law we have pass it time and time again we have all vote for
 that in fact the last time i believ wa about 6 month ago
 we will have our next opportun to vote to reaffirm that prohibit on the foreign oper bill in a coupl of month no on need to worri about where thei stand on that
 so when the propon of the hous mexico citi languag sai it i need to ensur that taxpay fund ar not us for abort thei conveni forget to mention that our law alreadi prohibit that i rememb the saturdai night live charact dana carvei who would sai isn't that conveni well for them it i conveni
 becaus what thei realli want to do i prohibit fund for privat organ that us their own fund for abort even where abort i legal in fact the version that i in thi confer report goe even further it would prohibit those privat organ from even speak about abort
 now can't you imagin how we would all react if the parliament or the congress or rule committe of ani other countri pass a law and stand up thei would sai in thi law no privat organ in the unit state can speak on a particular issu lord love u all mr presid there would be such a flood of senat and hous member to come down and sai how dare thei how dare thei in that and fill in the blank of whatev countri it i how dare thei tell the unit state what to sai or peopl in the unit state what thei can sai
 yet that i what the hous would have u do we would laugh them out of the chamber becaus it would so obvious violat our first amend but we have some in the other bodi who do not believ that privat organ even american organ have the right of free speech outsid our countri
 i wa go to sai that thei should reread our histori but it i appar that i presum too much thei should simpli read it do we realli want to go down thi road thi isn't a democrat issu or a republican issu it i a free speech issu it i about the right of peopl to voic their opinion a repres of privat organ where it i legal to do so it i shame for the u congress which the world look to a a beacon of free speech and democraci to even think of curtail that right and yet the hous would have u do that in countri that ar struggl to becom more democrat and more free
 what kind of an exampl i that how can the same peopl stand up and sai we stand for the principl of america except in those instanc where thei conflict with whatev our polit agenda i and then we ar will to trampl on them
 what i describ innoc a a lobbi ban i in fact a gag rule that fli in the face of effort to reduc unsaf abort worldwid privat organ receiv u fund would be prohibit from even call attent to defect in legal abort law thei would be prohibit from try to make abort safer and reduc the number of women worldwid hundr of thousand of women who die from unsaf abort why on earth would we want to do that
 member of the hous argu thei have made a difficult concess by allow the presid to waiv on of the restrict either thei ar joke or thei assum we do not bother to read what we ar vote on thei fail to mention that if the presid exercis the waiver which thei fulli expect him to do scarc famili plan fund would be cut an addit $44 million in thi year alon mean a $224 million cut from the 1995 level
 what would be the consequ million of women who might otherwis receiv access to famili plan would becom pregnant and there would be million of abort that otherwis would have been prevent the evid that voluntari famili plan reduc unwarr pregnanc and abort i beyond disput it can be seen in everi countri in the world the ironi i that the provis sent to u by the other bodi would result in more abort not fewer becaus it would sharpli cut fund for famili plan
 now let u be honest thei sai thei don't want abort that i fine i respect that who want abort i wish there would never be anoth on but you don't accomplish that by cut monei for famili plan it i so logic if you have good famili plan the number of unwant pregnanc goe down and the number of abort goe down you can't sai we don't want you to have abort but we also don't want you to have contracept be honest that i what it come down to
 studi done in the unit state show that the us of famili plan reduc the probabl of a woman have an abort by a stagger 85 percent in russia the averag woman had seven abort in her life but sinc aid began provid modern contracept to russia the number of abort ha gone wai down and continu to go down
 in kazakhstan aid support for famili plan clinic led to a 59 percent increas in contracept us and a 41 percent decreas in abort among women serv by the clinic there have been similar declin of abort when contracept were made avail from latin america to eastern europ in on of the poorest countri bangladesh where abort i prohibit educ about contracept and altern to abort ha contribut to a signific reduct in fertil rate over the past 10 year even in bangladesh where abort i illeg 50,000 women ar hospit each year becaus of complic from illeg unsaf abort famili plan fund will help reduc those number these ar women live that ar save why do the peopl who support the mexico citi languag not care about them i it becaus thei live in a differ countri
 anoth argument thei make i that although u fund ar not spent on abort thei free up other fund that ar spent on abort the old monei i fungibl argument do thei realli want to go down that road do thei realli want to sai we cannot send aid to countri becaus thei might us some of that aid on abort becaus abort i legal there doe that mean that becaus abort i legal in israel we give aid to israel it i deposit in the isra treasuri that we should shut off u aid to israel becaus other isra govern fund ar us for abort whoop not go to do that and i am not suggest we should obvious we ar not go to cut aid to israel becaus the isra govern support abort but why should the rule be differ for privat citizen if anyth thei should have more protect to speak freeli thei ar not a govern thei ought to be abl to speak freeli
 should we stop fund nuclear safeti program in russia becaus abort i legal there and abort ar provid at govern hospit should we sai that we will put at risk the live of american for a nuclear accid and cut off fund for nuclear safeti program in russia becaus thei won't make abort illeg mayb we should cut off aid to ani state in the unit state becaus abort i legal that would be all 50 state
 of all thing famili plan i someth we should support unlik nuclear safeti it doe help reduc the number of abort yet the mexico citi polici would prevent u from support privat famili plan organ crazi absolut crazi
 mr presid whether you ar pro-choic or pro-lif you should oppos the mexico citi polici on of my best friend in the u senat a man i admir greatli a man who wa a mentor to me when i first came to the senat serv a chairman of our senat appropri committe i now retir the former distinguish senior senat from oregon senat hatfield he i strongli pro-lif i greatli respect senat mark hatfield for that i greatli respect him for a lot of thing becaus i felt he wa a man who alwai follow hi conscienc he oppos the mexico citi polici not becaus he i pro-abort he wa adamantli the other wai but becaus he said if you have famili plan especi with the u prohibit against us it for abort if you have famili plan the number of abort will go down he knew from the hear we had in the appropri
 vote for the mexico citi polici mai make for a good press releas but it would cut fund for famili plan it would increas the number of abort we should reject thi attempt to push thi misguid polici down our throat we should send the bill back to the hous
 mr presid befor i yield the floor i want to sai a final word about the tactic us here these ar vital import foreign polici program but thi i the second time in 6 month that the hous ha us thi type of blackmail thi i the second time in 6 month a small group in the hous ha push their polit agenda no matter how much damag it might do to the integr and the word of the unit state worldwid last year it wa the imf and un fund thi year it i the un fund and thei ar threaten again to block fund for the imf if that fail it would be fund for disast relief in vermont or california or minnesota oregon or anywher els
 and all becaus thei do not have the vote to overrid a veto of the mexico citi polici whatev happen to democraci to the legisl process instead we have a hand who prefer gridlock and blackmail thei shut down the govern first and now thi if it were up to them thei would hold hostag billion of dollar for these econom and secur program indefinit no wonder the congress i seen by so mani american a an embarrass
 mr presid i have been proud to serv in the u senat for almost 24 year i am proud that the peopl of vermont have sent me to thi bodi in our over 200-year histori i am the onli member of my parti to ever serv in the u senat but the other parti sent great great leader that i rever and admir peopl i try to emul the senat from vermont have alwai felt that the integr of the unit state must be protect that the unit state when it give it word must stand by it the first ambassador to the unit nation wa a vermont who gave up hi seat in the u senat to be appoint to that post to again stand up and sai that when the unit state give it word it keep it
 i hope that some mostli in the other bodi and mayb some in thi bodi will step back and sai let u worri less about our own polit live and our own polit futur for whatev short moment that mai be and think in the long term for our countri none of u own a seat in the u senat i don't the distinguish presid offic doesn't none of u do it i the same in the other bodi we ar privileg and honor to repres our state for the time that we ar here most of u do it with a great deal of care and in the interest of our state and our countri i know my friend who ar on the floor here at thi moment ar all peopl who fall into that categori
 but there ar alwai time when we have to sai that the polit interest we mai have individu ar greatli outweigh by the interest of the unit state of america becaus we will come and go the countri will remain and the countri can either be weaken or strengthen by what we do thi i a time when we ought to stand up and fulfil the oblig of the unit state fulfil our high standard and keep our word so in thi case i hope that thi confer report i defeat
 mr presid i yield the floor
