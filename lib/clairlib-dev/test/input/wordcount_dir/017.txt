   ROME, Feb 17 (AFP) - Up to 200,000 Sudanese Christians who fled  
fighting in the south and set up a village near Khartoum have been 
chased into a desert zone, the Vatican missionary news agency FIDES 
said Wednesday. 
   Between 150,000 and 200,000 Christians set up the village in  
Hajj Youssef, northeast of the Sudanese capital, but local 
authorities forced them to leave their homes and set up living 
quarters in the desert about 10 kilometers (six miles) away. 
   They were transported to the area free of charge, the report  
said. 
   Sudan's civil war, which erupted in 1983, pits Christians and  
animists in the south against the Khartoum government in the Moslem 
and Arabized north. 
   According to official figures, Sudan is 63 percent Moslem, 13  
percent Christian and 24 animist.
