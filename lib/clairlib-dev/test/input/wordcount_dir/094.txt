   BERLIN, Feb 17 (AFP) - Three Kurds were killed outside the  
Israeli consulate in Berlin Wednesday when Israeli security guards 
opened fire to prevent protestors from storming the building, police 
said. 
   Fourteen were injured in the incident, a police spokesman said.  
Most suffered bullet wounds. 
   The police did not open fire in the incident, they said, adding  
that major police reinforcements had been rushed to the area. 
   The incident happened amid a continuing wave of Kurdish protests  
at the capture of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. 
   Earlier Wednesday, officials in Jerusalem said Israel had put  
its embassies and other missions in Europe on a heightened security 
alert. 
   The German news agency DPA on Tuesday quoted Western  
intelligence sources as saying Israel's Mossad foreign intelligence 
agency played a "decisive" role in helping Turkey catch Ocalan. 
Israeli officials categorically denied the accusation. 
   Israel and Turkey have built up close cooperation in military  
and security fields since signing a bilateral defense pact in 1996, 
although there has been no confirmation of links between the two 
countries' intelligence agencies.
