   BUDAPEST, Feb 13 (AFP) - The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland  
are to join NATO on March 12, Hungary's MTI news agency quoted the 
US embassy here as saying on Saturday. 
   The ceremony is to be held at the Harry Truman Library in  
Independence, Missouri, the report indicated. NATO was founded 
during Truman's presidency. 
   MTI quoted the US ambassador in Budapest, Peter Tufo, as paying  
tribute to the Hungarian people who struggled to put their Communist 
heritage behind them and to play a leading role in central Europe. 
   The report confirmed a statement Thursday by the Polish foreign  
ministry spokesman that Poland would join the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization on March 12. 
   Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are to be the first  
former Warsaw Pact nations to join NATO, which celebrates its 50th 
anniversary in April.
