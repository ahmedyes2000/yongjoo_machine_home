   KAMPALA, Feb 17 (AFP) - An Austrian businessman and seven  
Ethiopians are among nine suspects arrested in connection with two 
bomb blasts which killed five people here late Sunday, security 
officials told AFP Wednesday. 
   The fifth victim, a Ugandan man who suffered serious injuries in  
the attack, died in hospital on Tuesday. 
   The explosions, belived to have been caused by home-made pipe  
bombs, injured 35 other people. 
   The New Vision newspaper named the Austrian suspect as Gernot  
Lucawiecki, the husband of the Ethiopian woman who owns the Family 
Shop, where one of the explosions occurred. 
   Lucawiecki's brother-in-law, Boruk Gonta, a student at Makerere  
University, was among those killed in the blast on Sunday night. 
   Other security sources told the New Vision that a sniffer dog at  
the scene of the blasts had led the security men to the Lucawieski's 
home. 
   The newspaper quoted the Austrian ambassador to Uganda, Anton  
Mair, that he had been informed that the suspects would be released 
on Tuesday, but they were still in custody on Wednesday morning. 
   Among those injured were an American, two Swiss, a Pakistani and  
an Ethiopian student who is reported to have suffered paralysis to 
lower parts of his body. 
   A senior security official Monday told AFP the bombs were  
similar to those planted by an urban terrorist wing of the rebel 
Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) during a spate of fatal bombings in 
Kampala last year. 
   The ADF have been active in western Uganda since 1996 in a bid  
to destablise the goverment of President Yoweri Museveni.
