   SEOUL, Feb 15 (AFP) - Russian President Boris Yeltsin has sent a  
message to North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-Il to congratulate 
him on his 57th birthday, Pyongyang said Monday. 
   In the message received on Friday, Yeltsin "sincerely"  
congratulated Kim Jong-Il on his birthday on February 16, "a 
significant day and the national holiday of the DPRK" (North Korea), 
the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. 
   KCNA quoted Yeltsin as saying: "I am convinced that the  
developing Russia-DPRK relationship in the spirit of friendship, 
good neighbourliness and cooperation conforms with the interests of 
the peoples of the two countries, and it will help consolidate peace 
and stability in the Korean peninsula and North-East Asia." 
   "I wish you good health and happiness and the people of the DPRK  
peace and prosperity." 
   Russia has diplomatic ties with both North Korea and the North's  
arch enemy, South Korea.
