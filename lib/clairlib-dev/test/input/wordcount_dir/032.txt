   KAMPALA, Feb 17 (AFP) - Rebels attacked a displaced people's  
camp in Uganda's western Bundibugyo district this week, killing five 
people and seriously wounding two others, police said Wednesday. 
   Those killed. who were all in one room when the Allied  
Democratic Forces (ADF) insurgents attacked late on Monday, included 
Serina Kabugho, a four-year old girl and a woman who was six months 
pregnant, Bundibugyo district police commissioner Charles 
Tumwesigye, told AFP by telephone. 
   "Over 10 rebels descended from the mountains and entered Masaka  
camp. They found some special constabulary in the camp, but when the 
exchange of fire was too much the police took off and the rebels 
took advantage of the darkness," said Tumwesigye. 
   The rebels fled before the army arrived at the camp, he added.  
   The attack on Masaka camp is the fourth such raid in western  
Uganda in the past two weeks. Some 25 people have died in the 
violence during that period. 
   Last week, the rebels attacked villages near Kityo camp in  
Bundibugyo killing 10 people. 
   Tumwesigye said he believed that the attacks were carried out by  
the same small group. 
   "We are now training some more local defence forces and the army  
is making a strategy to deploy more here," he added. 
   The ADF, a coalition of an Islamist sect, known as Tabliq,  
remnants of a defunct rebel group and soldiers from deposed regimes 
in Rwandan and the former Zaire, has been fighting since 1996 in an 
attempt to destabalise the government of President Yoweri Museveni 
who they accuse of trying to set up an empire of ethnic Tutsis in 
the region. 
   The rebels operate out of bases the Ruwenzori mountains which  
straddle the Uganda's border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.
