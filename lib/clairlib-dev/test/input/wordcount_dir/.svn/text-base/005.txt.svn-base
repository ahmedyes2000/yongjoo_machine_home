	VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 12 (UPI) -- A British Columbia court  
has handed down a verdict of not guilty for three men charged with 
assault and attempted murder during a riot outside a Sikh temple two 
years ago. 
	A fourth man arrested and tried with them was convicted today of  
illegal possession of a weapon. 
	The incident arose out of a dispute at a Sikh temple in a Vancouver  
suburb, where fundamentalist worshipers objected to the use of chairs 
and tables for ritual dinners. 
	Police had to intervene when fundamentalist and moderate worshipers  
clashed, some of them drawing swords. At least one person was reportedly 
stabbed and injured. 
	The two sides have been struggling for control of the temple for  
several years. 
	Last year, the Sikh high priest in Amritsar, India, came down on the  
side of the fundamentalists, ordering the removal of the tables and 
chairs from the temple, but the moderates vowed to continue their 
struggle. 
	Earlier this week, a report from Amritsar said the high priest,  
Ranjit Singh, has been removed from his post.
