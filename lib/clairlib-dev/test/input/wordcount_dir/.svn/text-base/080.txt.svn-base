   ADDIS ABABA, Feb 17 (AFP) - Ethiopian planes made a second raid  
against Harsele, an Eritrean army logistical base 20 kilometres (12 
miles) west of the Red Sea port of Assab, the Ethiopian government 
spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
   The air strike on Harsele late Tuesday followed an attack  
earlier in the day by Ethiopian MiG-23 fighter-bombers reported to 
be responding to an Eritrean artillery bombardment, she said. 
   Aircraft "destroyed weapons and munitions, heavy artillery,  
armoured vehicles, military rations and a water reservoir at the 
support centre," according to an Ethiopian communique issued Tuesday 
evening. 
   "The Eritreans also suffered the loss of military personnel," it  
said. 
   In Assab, an Eritrean army officer said Tuesday afternoon that  
three Ethiopian MiG-23 fighter-bombers had attacked a water 
reservoir located some 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Assab itself, 
but missed their target. 
   "The Ethiopian airforce once again bombed Harsele at 10:45 p.m.  
(2145 GMT)" Ethiopian spokeswoman Salome Tadesse said Wednesday 
morning. 
   On Tuesday, she said there had been heavy exchanges of artillery  
fire on the eastern front, some 70 kilometres (40 miles) from 
Assab. 
   Renewed hostilities in a conflict between the two Horn of Africa  
countries, which first erupted last May over disputed border 
territory, broke out early this month after a seven-month lull.
