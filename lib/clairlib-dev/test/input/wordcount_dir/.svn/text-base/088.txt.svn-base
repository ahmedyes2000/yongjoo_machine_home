	MIAMI, Feb. 15 (UPI) -- A number of American pop music stars have  
announced they will spend a week in Cuba next month performing with 
Cuban musicians at the Karl Marx Theater in Havana. 
	Jimmy Buffet, Public Enemy leader Chuck D and Joan Osborne are among  
the performers who will travel to the island March 21-27. It will mark 
the first time since 1979 that American stars have performed in Cuba. 
	The project was organized by Alan Roy Scott, a Los Angeles-based  
songwriter who has organized similar efforts in the former Soviet Union, 
Romania and Ireland. 
	Scott said: ``The reason I'm doing this in Cuba is the same reason I  
did it in Russia. We all share one planet. Music is a great 
communicator.'' 
	The project, called ``The Music Bridge,'' has been sanctioned by the  
U.S. Treasury Department. But there are concerns among Miami's Cuban 
exile community, which questions how real the musical exchange will be. 
	Ricardo Pau-Llosa, a Cuban-American poet and art critic, doubts the  
legitimacy of the efforts, saying, ``I understand the rationale, but I 
think it's disingenous and falsely naive.'' 
	Pau-Llosa says he fears Cuban musicians represent the Castro regime  
in one way or another. 
	None of the Americans or Cubans will be paid for participation in the  
concerts. 
	In the past two years, a number of Cuban performers have appeared in  
the U.S. 
	A show in Miami drew protesters and a large, enthusiastic audience.
