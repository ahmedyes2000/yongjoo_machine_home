   KUWAIT CITY, Feb 17 (AFP) - A UN committee will hand over 84.12  
million dollars in reparations for victims of the 1990 Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait on Thursday, the emirate's official news agency 
KUNA said. 
   The Public Authority for Assessment of Damages told KUNA that  
the money would go to residents who were forced to flee Kuwait and 
individuals with compensation claims of up to 100,000 dollars each. 
   A total of 33,801 people are to benefit, within 19 days of  
Kuwait's central bank receiving the latest instalment on Thursday. 
   The UN compensation fund is drawn from Iraqi oil exports  
authorized by the United Nations. Seventy percent of the oil 
revenues go toward imports of humanitarian supplies for Iraq's 
sanctions-hit population. 
   The sanctions have stayed in place since the 1990 invasion.  
Iraqi troops were evicted from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War.
