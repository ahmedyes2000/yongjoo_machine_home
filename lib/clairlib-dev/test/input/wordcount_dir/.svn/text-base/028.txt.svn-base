   TEGUCIGALPA, Feb 14 (AFP) - Honduran police have caught a  
Cuban-American wanted for drug trafficking in the United States 
since 1994, police officials said Sunday. 
   Raul Hernandez Alfaro, 45, was arrested by police at dawn on  
Saturday in San Pedro Sula, some 240 kilometers (140 miles) north of 
the capital. 
   The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been looking  
for Alfaro since 1994. 
   Although carrying Honduran identity papers, Alfaro is to be  
deported to the United States, police said.
