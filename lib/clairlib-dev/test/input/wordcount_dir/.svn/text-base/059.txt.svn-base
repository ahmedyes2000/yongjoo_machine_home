	VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 12 (UPI) -- Two ships are adrift  
without power off the British Columbia coast, and Canadian rescue 
helicopters have been standing by to bring the crew members ashore if 
necessary. 
	The vessels, a Greek freighter and a Liberian-registered cargo ship,  
have been adrift for several hours near the northern shore of Vancouver 
Island as hurricane-force winds lashed the area. 
	Military officials at the Search and Rescue Center in the area say  
the lives of the crew members in both vessels could be in danger, and 
rescue helicopters are standing by to lift them off the vessels if 
necessary. 
	There are said to be 24 crew members on board the Greek ship and  
another 20 on the Liberian vessel. 
	The ships began drifting without power today after both reported  
engine problems. At one point, they were in danger of smashing into the 
Scott Islands, rocky outcrops near the northern end of Vancouver Island. 
	The rough weather has kept Coast Guard vessels from reaching the two  
ships and bringing the crews to safety. 
	At last reports, the Coast Guard said the ships were seen moving  
toward open water, but they could be in danger again if the wind 
changes.
