   ABIDJAN, Feb 14 (AFP) - Canadian Governor General Romeo Le Blanc  
and his wife Diana on Sunday arrived here for a four-day official 
visit, official sources said. 
   Le Blanc is accompanied by the minister for international  
cooperation and the francophonie, Diana Marleau, along with a 
delegation of legislative deputies and civil servants, a press 
communique from the Canadian embassy to Cote d'Ivoire said. 
   The Canadian leader is to meet with President Henri Konan Bedie  
and Prime Minister Kablan Duncan, as well as with other members of 
government. 
   His visit aims to "demonstrate multi-form efforts and varied  
investments by Canada in Africa," and to "recognized African 
movement and change," the communique added. 
   "Canada is ready to accompany African countries who have  
embarked on necessary economic, political, and social reforms, on 
their path towards development and properity," the statement said. 
   It also stressed Cote d'Ivoire plays "an important role in the  
consolidation of peace," through the creation of a "regional 
peacekeeping center," and portrayed the country as a "region of 
promising economic growth." 
   Canadian support for Cote d'Ivoire covers four main fields:  
balance of payments (fertilizers and generic medicines), the private 
and cooperative sectors, management of natural resources, and 
democracy and responsible government. 
   After leaving here, Le Blanc and his delegation will continue an  
African tour until February 28, with stops planned in Tanzania, 
Mali, Morroco, and Senegal.
