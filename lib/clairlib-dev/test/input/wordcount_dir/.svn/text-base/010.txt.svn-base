   BUDAPEST, Feb 17 (AFP) - Former film star and animal rights  
activist Brigitte Bardot is to step in to help save a six-strong 
wolf family in southern Hungary, a report said Wednesday. 
   Hunters want to target the wolves which have been picking on  
sheep in the Kiskunsag National Wildlife Park in southern Hungary 
since last May, when they strayed, probably from Romania. 
   Bardot says she backs the park authorities who have refused to  
grant official permission to kill the animals. "I shall consult my 
advisers about the situation, on how we could save the wolf family," 
she said. 
   The head of the park Istvan Toelgyesi issued a ban on shooting  
them last week, according to the Blikk newspaper. 
   "How interesting that hunters asked for a permission to shoot  
them in the winter season when their fur is the most valuable," he 
was quoted as saying. 
   Wolves have been extinct for decades in Hungary where thick  
forests are sparse, but are considered a protected species.
