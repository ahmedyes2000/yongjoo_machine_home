   MOSCOW, Feb 17 (AFP) - The ruble gained more than one percent  
against the dollar on Wednesday to 22.87 to the greenback, Interfax 
reported. 
   Volume was heavier than in recent days at 182 million dollars on  
the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange as the ruble climbed 24 
kopecks from Tuesday's rate of 23.11, the news agency said. 
   The Russian unit remains well below the 21.5 to the dollar rate  
on which the government has based its budget calculations for this 
year.
