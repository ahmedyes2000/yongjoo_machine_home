   SOFIA, Feb 15 (AFP) - Nineteen Bulgarian doctors and nurses have  
been held in Libya since last week and subjected to AIDS tests after 
cases of the disease were registered in the hospital where they 
work, Bulgarian newspapers reported on Monday. 
   The Libyan embassy here said the Bulgarians were held in a  
hospital, while the Bulgarian embassy in Tripoli said 23 of its 
nationals had been arrested and four freed. It said the remaining 19 
were expected to be released later on Monday. 
   The newspaper 24 Chassa quoted the husband of one of the nurses  
as saying the 23 -- 21 women and two men -- were arrested and carted 
off to an unknown destination. 
   Trud newspaper said that several cases of AIDS have been  
detected in the Benghazi region, qoting a Bulgarian doctor who 
recently returned from Libya. 
   The doctor said Bulgarian medical personnel were in trouble with  
Libyan authorities for divulging cases of AIDS, a disease which 
officially does not exist in Libya.
