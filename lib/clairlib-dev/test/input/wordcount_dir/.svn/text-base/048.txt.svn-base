   OUAGADOUGOU, Feb 15 (AFP) - The February 14 Collective of  
Burkina Faso opposition parties on Monday demanded the unconditional 
release of detained Guinean opposition leader Alpha Conde, arrested 
in December. 
   The group of nine opposition parties issued a "motion on  
democratic freedoms in Guinea-Conakry" and urged that country's 
President Lansana Conte to "guarantee effective respect" for such 
liberties. 
   The February 14 group, marking the first anniversary of its  
creation, said "Burkinabe democrats should also demand that Guinean 
authorities free Mr. Conde." 
   The leader of the Guinean People's Rally was arrested and  
accused of "plotting against the regime" in Guinea after returning 
from exile to contest elections in the west African country, which 
he lost to the incumbent Conte. 
   His case has been widely taken up and in the eyes of the  
opposition here, it was an occasion to denounce "the increasingly 
autocratic and backward methods of government used by Guinean 
authorities". 
   On domestic affairs, the head of the February 14 Group, set up  
to fight for an independent polling commission and other electoral 
reforms, said that it had seen "globally positive" progress in the 
past year. 
   Hermann Yameogo, chairman of the coalition, said that "regarding  
our activities, the echoes we've heard in public opinion and the 
place it (the group) now has on the national political scene, the 
record is positive overall." 
   Unable to achieve what it had sought ahead of the presidential  
elections held on November 15 last year, the Collective urged people 
to boycott the poll, which saw President Blaise Compaore returned to 
office with 56.8 percent of the votes. 
   The February 14 Group is part of a broader movement of  
politicians, lawyers and other professional figures which was formed 
shortly after the December 13 death in a highly suspicious car crash 
of journalist Norbert Zongo, a renowned critic of the regime, with 
three others in the vehicle. 
   "The assassination of Norbert Zongo and his companions shocked a  
whole people, who suddenly discovered the ugliness of a corrupt 
political system, living on lies and impunity," a statement from the 
opposition group said.
