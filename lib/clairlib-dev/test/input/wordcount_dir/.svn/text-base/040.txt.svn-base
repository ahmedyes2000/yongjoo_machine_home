	MIAMI, Feb. 16 (UPI) -- Three Cuban-American families who lost  
relatives who were shot down by Cuban MiGs are in a Miami federal court 
demanding the $187 million judgment they were awarded against the 
Republic of Cuba and the Cuban Air Force last year. 
	The families want the court to garnishee payments made to the  
Republic of Cuba by several U.S. long distance carriers, including AT&T, 
MCI and IDB Worldcom Services Inc., for the right to provide long 
distance telephone service. 
	But the companies and the U.S. State Department are resisting the  
families' efforts to collect the funds. 
	State Department officials are aligned with the Cuban government on  
the issue, apparently fearing the Cuban government may make good on a 
threat to cut off direct telephone service between the U.S. and the 
island nation if scheduled payments are not made by the U.S. carriers. 
	Four men were shot down in international waters in 1996 by Cuban  
aircraft while flying with the Cuban exile group, Brothers to the 
Rescue. The family of one of those who died in the incident was not 
allowed to participate in the suit because the man was not a U.S. 
citizen. 
	U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King has set two hours for each  
side to present oral arguments.
