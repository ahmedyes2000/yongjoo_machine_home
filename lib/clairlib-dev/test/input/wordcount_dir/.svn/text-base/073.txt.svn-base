   ALGIERS, Feb 14 (AFP) - A small earthquake shook the area near  
Boumerdes, about 60 kilometres (40 miles) southeast of Algiers late 
on Sunday night, Algerian scientists said. 
   The quake measured 3.7 on the Richter scale which has a  
theoretical maximum of nine, according to the Algerian Centre for 
Research in Astrophysics and Geography (CRAAG). 
   The CRAAG did not say if the quake caused any casualties or  
damage.
