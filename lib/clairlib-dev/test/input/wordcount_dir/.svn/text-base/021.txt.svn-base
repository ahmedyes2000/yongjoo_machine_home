   TRIPOLI, Feb 13 (AFP) - Libya announced Saturday that mediation  
efforts had led to "positive results" in the Lockerbie affair amid 
reports an agreement had been reached for the Libyan suspects in the 
1988 bombing to be jailed in Scotland if convicted. 
   "Positive results were reached in the Lockerbie matter thanks to  
the intensive efforts of Saudi Arabia and South Africa," the foreign 
ministry said in a statement, quoted by the Libyan JANA news 
agency. 
   Libya expressed the hope that the sanctions imposed against it  
in 1992 over the affair would soon be ended. 
   "All that remains is for coordination with the UN secretary  
general Kofi Annan and the other parties involved" to get the 
sanctions lifted, the statement said. 
   Western diplomats in New York said Saturday that Tripoli has  
agreed that the two Libyans wanted for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing 
that left 270 dead would serve jail terms in Scotland if found 
guilty. 
   The decision is part of an agreement accepted by Washington and  
London, which was being drafted by UN chief Kofi Annan's legal team, 
the diplomats told AFP.
