   WASHINGTON, Feb 16 (AFP) - A Pentagon delegation headed to  
Moscow Tuesday for talks on the year 2000 (Y2K) computer problem 
with the Russian military as well as other defense issues, Pentagon 
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. 
   The Pentagon has offered to cooperate with the Russians on the  
Y2K problem, amid US concerns that Russia's nuclear command and 
control systems could be vulnerable to the so-called millennium 
bug. 
   Washington has proposed sharing missile early warning data with  
Moscow as one way to counter misunderstandings that could arise from 
computer failures when the year 2000 rolls in. 
   Bacon said the delegation led by Ted Warner, assistant secretary  
of defense for strategy and requirements, will hold talks on 
US-Russian military relations while in Moscow, including the Y2K 
issue. 
   It also will join in meetings in Moscow of a US-Russian  
Strategic Stability Group headed on the US side by Deputy Secretary 
of State Strobe Talbott, which also will take up Y2K problem.
