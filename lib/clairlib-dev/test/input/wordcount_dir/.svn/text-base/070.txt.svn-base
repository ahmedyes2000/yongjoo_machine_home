   MOSCOW, Feb 14 (AFP) - Russian President Boris Yeltsin may be  
compelled to further shorten his workday at the Kremlin because of a 
flu epidemic hitting the Russian capital, a spokesman said Sunday. 
   Presidential spokesman Dimitry Yakushkin told TV6 television  
that Yeltsin's doctors may advise him to spend fewer hours at work, 
according to the ITAR-TASS news agency. 
   Some 100,000 people in Moscow have been hit by the flu virus  
that has left 18 dead in Russia, according to the latest toll. 
   Yeltsin, 68, has been plagued with ill health since the fall.  
   The Russian president currently spends most of his days in a  
country retreat and has worked only a few hours per day at the 
Kremlin since the beginning of February. 
   Yeltsin struggled throughout January to recover from a bleeding  
ulcer. 
   Defying his doctors, he traveled to Amman last week to pay his  
respects to King Hussein but he did not stay long enough to attend 
the funeral. Television broadcasts of his trip to Amman showed 
Yeltsin looking tired and gaunt.
