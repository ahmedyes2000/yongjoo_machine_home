   MEXICO CITY, Feb 14 (AFP) - Some 400 people were evacuated in  
western Mexico amid a significant increase of activity in the Volcan 
de Fuego volcano, authorities said Sunday. 
   They said the decision to evacuate people living within 10  
kilometers (eight miles) of the crater was taken after a significant 
increase in seismic activity inside the volcano was registered. 
   The Volcan de Fuego -- Spanish for volcano of fire -- situated  
some 450 kilometers (280 miles) west of Mexico City, is one of the 
most active volcanos in Mexico. 
   About 15,000 people live within a 15-kilometer (10-mile) radius  
of the crater. The city of Colima, population 150,000, is 35 
kilometers (21 miles) away.
