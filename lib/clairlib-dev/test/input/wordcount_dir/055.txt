   MERIDA, Mexico, Feb 14 (AFP) - US President Bill Clinton arrived  
here Sunday for a bilateral summit expected to focus partly on drug 
trafficking and illegal immigration. 
   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo welcomed Clinton and US First  
Lady Hillary Clinton upon arrival at the airport of this Caribbean 
city currently gripped by carnival fever. 
   Hundreds of people cheered and folkloric groups performed  
traditional dances from the Yucatan peninsula as the Clintons 
emerged from Air Force One, smiling and waving. 
   Several top US officials traveled with Clinton, including  
anti-drug czar Barry McCaffrey, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and 
several members of Congress. 
   The Clintons and the Zedillos were due to have a private dinner  
together Sunday night, Valentine's night, known here as the Day of 
Love and Friendship, and marked by millions of Mexicans. 
   On Monday, the presidents were due to sit down for bilateral  
talks that were expected to partly focus on drugs and illegal 
immigration, but also on economic issues. Clinton was due to head 
back to Washington on Monday afternoon.
