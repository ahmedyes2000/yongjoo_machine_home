   MOSCOW, Feb 17 (AFP) - An explosion on a stretch of gas pipeline  
between Yakutsk and Pokrovsk in eastern Siberia, has deprived 25,000 
people in the area of heating, ITAR-TASS reported Wednesday. 
   More than 200 people were working round the clock to repair the  
pipeline to stop the crippled heating systems freezing completely, 
it said. 
   The blast on Tuesday happened 19 kilometres (12 miles) from  
Irkutsk and has cut off gas supplies to several towns. 
   The local authorities were organising supplies of liquid fuel to  
the population, the report said.
