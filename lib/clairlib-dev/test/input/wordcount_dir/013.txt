   BUENOS AIRES, Dec 18 (AFP) - The former head of Argentina's  
military high command confirmed Friday that Argentine weapons turned 
up in Croatia in 1992, when that country was under an international 
arms embargo. 
   Retired general Mario Diaz made the revelation during testimony  
before Judge Jorge Urso, who is investigating allegations of illegal 
sales of arms to Croatia, and to Ecuador when it was at war with 
Peru in 1995. 
   Diaz said that in 1992, Colonel Luis Hilario Lagos, the  
commander of an Argentine battalion in Croatia, told him that 
Croatian soldiers had been found armed with light arms from 
Argentina. 
   Official documents said that the weapons intended for Panama,  
which has no armed forces, had been diverted to the former 
Yugoslavia.
