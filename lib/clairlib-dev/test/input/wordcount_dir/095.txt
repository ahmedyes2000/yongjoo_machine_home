   VIENNA, Feb 17 (AFP) - International arbitrators wrapped up  
hearings Wednesday on the disputed Bosnian town of Brcko, with 
Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Moslems hoping for a decision on its fate 
within weeks. 
   US judge Roberts Owen, who has chaired the closed-door sessions  
for the last 10 days, is expected to draw up his conclusions by 
mid-March, according to participants at the hearings in a Vienna 
hotel. 
   Both sides have notably warned against a new delay in deciding  
the fate of the town, which lies in a narrow strip of land 
connecting the eastern and western parts of the Republika Srpska 
(RS). 
   "The feeling is that over the last three years we have gone  
through all the arguments. We hope there will be a decision soon," 
said one source, requesting anonymity. 
   The new hearings in Vienna follow postponements of a decision in  
1997 and 1998 amid fears of renewed conflict over a decision on the 
strategic town. 
   Leaders of the RS and the Croat-Moslem Federation gave their  
closing arguments on Tuesday in their dispute over the town, left in 
limbo since the end of the 1992-95 war. 
   Veteran Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic called for the town to  
be given to the Croat-Moslem Federation, while saying he would not 
oppose its declaration as a neutral district under international 
supervision for a limited period. 
   But the Serb head of Bosnia's collegiate presidency Zivko  
Radisic notably slammed the much-touted neutral district proposal, 
which would take Brcko out of the RS territory. 
   He said it would therefore require a revision of the Dayton  
peace accord, which promised 49 percent of Bosnian territory to the 
Bosnian Serbs and 51 percent to the Croat-Moslem Federation. 
   "To create a district for Brcko would require a revision of the  
Dayton peace accords," he said, adding: "The future of Bosnia and of 
Dayton is in the hands of the arbitrators." 
   The Dayton peace accord left unresolved the problem of Brcko,  
which the Serbs occupied during the Bosnian war after driving out 
the Moslems and Croats who previously formed a majority of the 
population. 
   But the decision could be postponed yet again, some sources  
suggest. 
   In particular, the situation in Kosovo could cloud the process,  
one source said. "If there are developments in Kosovo, it may well 
be difficult to announce a ruling," said one participant at the 
talks. 
   The risk of renewed conflict has been underlined by both sides.  
"If the fate of Brcko is threatened, it will be the start of new 
divisions which can only generate new conflicts in the region," said 
Radisic recently.
