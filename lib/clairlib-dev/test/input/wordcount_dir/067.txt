   LIMA, Feb 14 (AFP) - Two inmates serving time for drug  
trafficking and fraud celebrated their birthdays with a banquet, 
live band and dancing, the El Comercio newspaper reported Sunday. 
   The celebrations came in defiance of government calls for  
stricter controls in prisons here. 
   Just a few days before the reported incident, Peruvian Justice  
Minister Maria Carlota Valenzuela told journalists she had handed 
down directives calling for increased control in the country's 
prisons, El Comercio said. 
   "There was enough food for the police and some members of the  
national penitentiary, but they were not allowed into the 
get-together," the newspaper reported.
