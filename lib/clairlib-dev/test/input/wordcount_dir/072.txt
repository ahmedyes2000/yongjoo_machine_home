   TRIPOLI, Dec 18 (AFP) - Thousands of Libyans demonstrated Friday  
in downtown Tripoli against US-British military raids on Iraq, a day 
after Libyan state television called for worldwide protests against 
the attacks, witnesses said. 
   The demonstration began at the end of weekly Moslem prayers and  
despite the rain, with protesters shouting slogans against the 
United States and Israel and criticizing "Arab regimes' inability to 
deal with plans to exterminate Arabs and Moslems," the witnesses 
said. 
   The official JANA news agency said Thursday that the strikes  
against Iraq were "a humiliation" for the entire Moslem world as it 
prepares for the holy fasting month of Ramadan, which begins this 
weekend.
