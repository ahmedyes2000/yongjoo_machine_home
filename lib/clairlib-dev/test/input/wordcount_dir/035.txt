   BUDAPEST, Feb 14 (AFP) - A five-day cold spell across eastern  
and central Europe claimed two more lives in Hungary overnight as 
fresh snow fell in parts of the region. 
   Polish authorities announced three more deaths on Saturday. A  
total of 202 people have perished in Poland since the start of the 
long, harsh winter. 
   Hungarian radio reported that a man, apparently drunk, froze to  
death in northern Komarom county, while an elderly woman died after 
being struck by a car on an icy road in Borsod, also in the north. 
   The latest incidents brought to 16 the total number of deaths in  
Hungary blamed on the wave of freezing cold and general bad weather 
across the region. 
   With hundreds of roads still blocked by snow and ice, Hungarian  
army helicopters on Sunday began ferrying kidney dialysis patients 
to a hospital in northeastern Niregyhaza, for vital treatment. 
   In Italy, firefighters reported that a 77-year-old man had been  
found frozen to death in a camper parked in central Rome, where 
overnight temperatures remained below freezing. 
   In Austria, fresh snow fell in the west on Sunday, but most  
roads in the east were reopened to traffic. 
   Hungary and Slovakia were the hardest hit by the cold wave.
