   WARSAW, Feb 15 (AFP) - Polish police have seized 25 kilos (55  
pounds) of Semtex explosive, enough to make "at least 100 powerful 
bombs," a police statement Monday said. 
   Five people -- four Poles and a Slovak national -- were arrested  
in the Polish cities of Lodz and Warsaw, it said. 
   The statement said the operation began in the middle of January,  
but did not say when the arrests took place.
