	OTTAWA, Feb. 12 (UPI) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana says  
alliance forces are in a state of readiness to strike in the Yugoslav 
province of Kosovo if the two sides in the dispute do not reach a peace 
agreement. 
	Solana was speaking to reporters in Ottawa today as representatives  
of the Serbian government held discussions, through mediators, with 
ethnic Albanian rebels from the Kosovo Liberation Army in a chateau near 
Paris. 
	The NATO chief blamed the Serbian side for the lack of progress in  
the talks, saying, ``We are having...very serious difficulties with the 
Serb party today.'' 
	He says the preparatory work has already been done, so NATO could  
take military action at any moment. 
	Solana is in Ottawa to ensure continued Canadian support for the use  
of force to bring peace to Kosovo in the event the talks fail. 
	Last month, Prime Minister Jean Chretien said Canada would support  
military intervention in Kosovo to restore peace to the region, 
including the use of ground troops if necessary. 
	NATO could send as many as 30,000 troops into Kosovo, but it is not  
clear whether the alliance wants Canadian troops to participate in 
combat missions or in a peacekeeping role.
