   WASHINGTON, Feb 17 (AFP) - French President Jacques Chirac  
begins an official visit to the United States Thursday as the White 
House returns to business as usual after the Senate impeachment 
trial. 
   Talks between the two leaders will likely be dominated by the  
subjects of Iraq and Kosovo, as President Bill Clinton switches his 
focus to international affairs following the conclusion of the 
impeachment saga. 
   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Chirac is hoping to use  
the occasion to press French proposals to lift the embargo on Iraq 
in exchange for the renewal of international weapons inspections. 
   "The President will give any ideas that President Chirac comes  
with due consideration," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said 
Tuesday. 
   But he dismissed talk of a rift between the two NATO partners  
over the Kosovo and Iraqi crises. 
   "Relations are strong. I think our government and the French  
government stand together as far as containing Saddam Hussein (is 
concerned)," Lockhart added. 
   Iraq's recent threats against its neighbor Kuwait were a  
reminder, Lockhart said, of "how important it is for the 
international community to stay united." 
   Other subjects on the leaders' agenda will include NATO's 50th  
anniversary summit which is due to be held in April in Washington; 
Russia; the Far and Middle East; Africa and Europe. 
   Trade issues such as the banana controversy will also figure in  
the discussions, according to officials in the Clinton 
administration. 
   Chirac, who will stop in New York and Washington during his  
brief visit, is due to arrive 12:00 a.m. (1700 GMT) Thursday and 
will stay at Blair House. 
   Afternoon meetings have been scheduled with Michel Camdessus at  
the International Monetary Fund and James Wolfensohn at the World 
Bank. 
   Their discussions are likely to focus on the reform of the  
international financial system in the wake of the crisis that swept 
through the economies of Asian countries, Russia and Brazil. 
   According to a spokesman at the Elysee Palace, this first visit  
by a French leader to the headquarters of the Bretton Woods 
institutions is an indication of the importance France attaches to 
them. 
   On Saturday, Chirac who made his last US official visit in 1996,  
will have a day off in New York with the exception of a lunch 
meeting with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. 
   Chirac is due to return to Paris Sunday morning.
