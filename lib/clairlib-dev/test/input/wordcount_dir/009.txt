   WARSAW, Feb 14 (AFP) - Inhabitants of the western Polish city of  
Poznan celebrated St Valentine's Day Sunday with a 300 kilo (660 
pound) heart-shaped pizza, which they were invited to first admire 
and then devour. 
   Eighteen chefs concocted the pizza from 100 kilos (220 pounds)  
of dough, 40 kilos of mushrooms and 25 kilos of ham, topped with 15 
buckets of grated cheese and 15 kilos of paprika, as well as 60 
kilos of tomato sauce. 
   They used two cranes to put the pizza into an enormous oven on  
the town's old market place. 
   However, when cut up into 4,000 slices, the locals made short  
work of finishing the pizza off.
