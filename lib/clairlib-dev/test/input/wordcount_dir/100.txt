   TAIPEI, Feb 15 (AFP) - President Lee Teng-hui pledged Monday to  
reform Taiwan's economy this year to restore confidence in the 
financial market. 
   "I promise that this year we will concentrate on economic and  
finanical issues to conduct the necessary reforms to strengthen the 
health of our economy," Lee said in his annual Lunar New Year Eve 
address. 
   "The government must take active and steady action to retore  
people's confidence," Lee said. 
   Several companies have been hit by financial troubles and Lee  
admitted that government measures had failed to ease the jittery 
market. 
   Taiwan's stock market has plunged to a nearly three-year low on  
the back of mounting financial troubles at local companies and 
concerns over bad loans in the banking sector. 
   Economic growth last year slipped to 4.83 percent, the lowest  
level for 15 years, amid a world economic downturn and Asia's 
financial crisis. 
   Lee urged Taiwanese to have confidence in Taiwan's fundamentals  
as many foreign institutional investors had given positive views on 
the island's economic prospects. 
   Taiwan was recently ranked third among the countries with the  
best economic outlook by the US Commerce Department among the United 
States' top 20 export markets, Lee said. 
   "People here should not lose faith in Taiwan's economy ... the  
country's overall economic performance and financial conditions are 
better than many other developing countries," he said. 
   "Financial problems at a small number of enterprises would  
certainly not shake our economic foundation," he added.
