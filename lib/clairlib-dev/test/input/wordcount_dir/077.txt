   MERIDA, Mexico, Feb 14 (AFP) - Mexican security agents Sunday  
punched and kicked three journalists from US networks who were here 
to cover a visit by US President Bill Clinton. 
   The agents from Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo's security  
detail assaulted the three in the lobby of the Fiesta Americana 
here, as Zedillo was leaving his suite in the hotel for a dinner he 
was hosting for Clinton. 
   Ruben Luengas, correspondent in Mexico for CBS-Telenoticias, ABC  
cameraman Javier Carillo and NBC cameraman Hermes Munoz were trying 
to interview Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario Green when the agents 
struck them. 
   Other Mexican cabinet members were in the hotel lobby at the  
time. 
   Luengas and Carrilo are Mexican and Munoz is Argentine.  
   The Foreign Correspondents' Association of Mexico issued a  
formal protest. A presidency official said the Mexican government 
promptly apologized to the three and that the agents would be 
punished.
