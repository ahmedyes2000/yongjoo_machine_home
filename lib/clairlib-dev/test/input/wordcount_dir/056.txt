   MEXICO CITY, Feb 14 (AFP) - The Mexican government is in talks  
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a line of credit of 
up to eight billion dollars, a leading newspaper here reported 
Sunday. 
   An IMF source in Washington told the daily La Jornada that the  
Mexican government is seeking a line of credit of between five 
billion and eight billion dollars. 
   "We hope the announcement of the loan will be ready in a few  
days," the IMF official told La Jornada. "For now the government has 
just made known the fact that it wants to negotiate a line of 
credit." 
   Eight billion dollars would be the largest amount of aid  
requested since early 1995, when the Mexican peso lost 60 percent of 
its value. 
   Reports of the talks come just two weeks after Finance Secretary  
Jose Angel Gurria told officials that Mexico would seek IMF and 
World Bank assistance to refinance foreign debts for 1999 and 2000. 
   It also came as US President Bill Clinton arrived in Merida  
Sunday for a 24-hour visit and talks with his Mexican counterpart 
Ernesto Zedillo. 
   An official at Mexico's Finance Ministry would not confirm or  
deny the report. 
   "Mexico is a partner with full rights in the IMF, and so has the  
option to use financing at any moment," the ministry official told 
the paper.
