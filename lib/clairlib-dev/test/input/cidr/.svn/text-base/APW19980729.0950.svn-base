	   Washington would oppose any presidential statement or resolution
``because it would appear to be rewarding Iraq when in fact it has
moved backward,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said.
	   A Russian-sponsored draft resolution would acknowledge Baghdad
had complied with Security Council resolutions requiring it destroy
its nuclear weapons.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said he was disappointed that
the council wasn't able to agree that Baghdad had complied with the
resolutions. As a compromise, Russia was trying to acknowledge
previous progress and register movement towards the eventual
shifting of nuclear inspections into less intrusive long-term
monitoring.
	   That too was unacceptable, Richardson said.
