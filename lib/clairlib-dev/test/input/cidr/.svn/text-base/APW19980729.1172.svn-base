	   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica (AP) _ Fidel Castro began a historic
Caribbean tour in this Jamaican tourist mecca Wednesday,
highlighting a campaign by the region's leaders to end the
three-decade U.S. embargo of communist Cuba.
	   Lightning flashed overhead and thunder rolled as Castro, wearing
his signature olive drab fatigues and bill cap, marched between the
ranks of an honor guard at the Montego Bay airport, his hand held
stiffly to his cap in salute.
	   Following cheers from airport workers and a 21-gun salute, a
smiling Castro, accompanied by Prime Minister P.J. Patterson,
walked down a long line of dignitaries, vigorously shaking hands
and hugging an acquaintance.
	   He and Patterson then headed to a public rally in Montego Bay.
	   Jamaica has led a Caribbean movement to re-establish diplomatic
and trade links with communist Cuba and has urged Washington to
increase its contacts with Havana.
	   ``There are many (U.S.) congressmen who feel strongly that the
U.S. ought to put an end to the embargo,'' Jamaica's Deputy Premier
Seymour Mullings said recently. ``We believe that within the U.S.
administration there is a strong feeling that more dialogue should
take place.''
	   Castro will spend six days in Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada. In
August, he joins other Caribbean leaders at a summit in the
Dominican Republic, which this year restored the diplomatic
relations it severed 37 years ago.
	   The most visible opposition to Castro's trip has come from
Grenada, where some politicians call his visit an insult to
Americans who invaded in 1983 to oust hard-line Marxists who had
overthrown a Cuba-allied regime. At the time, some U.S. strategists
feared Grenada could help Castro export his revolution.
	   Forty-five Grenadians, 29 Cubans and 18 U.S. troops were killed
during the invasion.
	   In Jamaica, ``we still have bitter memories'' of Castro's
attempt to export his revolution in the 1970s, said conservative
opposition leader Edward Seaga.
	   Seaga, a former prime minister, told The Associated Press that
he still blamed Castro for Jamaica's 1970s experiment in socialism
that bankrupted the country. After his 1980 election, Seaga closed
the Cuban Embassy.
	   Yet Seaga, who meets with Castro on Thursday, said that the end
of the Cold War had neutralized Cuba as a threat. ``I don't think
we need to fight yesterday's war today,'' he said.
	   Relations with Cuba were restored in 1989 when socialist leader
Michael Manley was re-elected. Manley's protege, Patterson, invited
Castro to Jamaica.
	   While arguing, 11th graf.
