\subsection{Extract N-Grams From a Batch of Files}
In this tutorial, we will extract n-grams from a batch of files and list them in a single text file along with the frequency with which they appear. To do this, we will use the utility 'extract\_ngrams.pl' and the text file 11sent.txt. 'extract\_ngrams.pl' takes either text files or html as input and can take multiple files. It extracts all n-grams (given n), and it has a few more options, as explained by

\begin{verbatim}
extract_ngrams.pl --help
\end{verbatim}

To find all 3-grams in 11sent.txt (with sentences segmented) and sort them in descending order, enter
\begin{verbatim}
 extract_ngrams.pl -r "11sent.txt" -f text \
 -w 11sent_3grams.txt -N 3 --segment --sort --verbose
\end{verbatim}

This should create the file '11sent\_3grams.txt' containing all 3-grams in 11sent.txt, with each sentence treated as a discrete entity. As the help command indicates, we can also extract n-grams from multiple files using the asterisk ('*') in the input file expression. For example, to extract n-grams in all files starting with "doc", use "doc*".
