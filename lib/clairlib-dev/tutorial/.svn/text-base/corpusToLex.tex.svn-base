\subsection{Create a Lexical Network from a Corpus}
In this tutorial, we will create a lexical network from a corpus. We will use the utility 'corpus\_to\_lexical\_network.pl', which will take as input a pre-indexed corpus and produce a graph where each node is a word and an edge exists between two words if they occur in the same sentences.  Multiple occurrences are weighted more. To see this utility's usage details, use the command

\begin{verbatim}
corpus_to_lexical_network.pl --help
\end{verbatim}

First off, we will copy the file 11sent.txt (http://belobog.si.umich.edu/clair/clairlib/11sent.txt) to our current working directory. Then, we will create a collection of documents with one line from 11sent.txt each using a utility called 'lines\_to\_docs.pl'. Then, we will create a corpus from that collection and index it.
\\
\\
\begin{boxedverbatim}

lines_to_docs.pl --input 11sent.txt --output 11sent_source
directory_to_corpus.pl --corpus 11Sent --base 11sent_produced \
 --directory 11sent_source
index_corpus.pl --corpus 11Sent --base 11sent_produced

\end{boxedverbatim}
\\
\\
Next, we can directly use the utility to stem the corpus create a lexical network, '11sent.graph':

\begin{verbatim}
corpus_to_lexical_network.pl -c 11Sent -b 11sent_produced \
 -o 11sent.graph --stem --verbose
\end{verbatim}

Now, our output file, '11sent.graph' contains a lexical network of stemmed terms.
