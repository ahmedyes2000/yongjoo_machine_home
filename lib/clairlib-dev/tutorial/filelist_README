Files named {core,ext}_{t,test,util}_filelist.txt contain lists of filenames.
They indicate which files in the subdirectories ../{t,test,util} end up being
distributed in Clairlib-core and which end up in Clairlib-ext.  These lists of
filenames are used by the perl script compile_test_lists.pl to determine what
section the link to a file should go under. 

After being generated simply via an appropriate "ls -1" command, they are
edited to remove scripts that duplicate functionality.  Any test in t/ that
shares a name with a script in test/ that differs only in its extension
(.t instead of .pl) has been removed from the *_t_filelist.txt file so that
is isn't included in the tutorial or online documentation.
