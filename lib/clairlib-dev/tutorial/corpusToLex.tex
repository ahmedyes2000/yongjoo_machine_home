\subsection{Create a Lexical Network from a Corpus}
In this tutorial, we will create a lexical network from a corpus. We will use the utility \emph{corpus\_to\_lexical\_network.pl}, which will take as input a pre-indexed corpus and produce a graph where each node is a word and an edge exists between two words if they occur in the same sentences.  Multiple occurrences are weighted more. To see this utility's usage details, use the command
\\
\\
\begin{boxedverbatim}
corpus_to_lexical_network.pl --help
\end{boxedverbatim}
\\
\\
First off, we will copy the file \emph{11sent.txt} (\emph{http://belobog.si.umich.edu/clair/clairlib/11sent.txt}) to our current working directory. Then, we will create a collection of documents with one line from 11sent.txt each using a utility called \emph{lines\_to\_docs.pl}. Then, we will create a corpus from that collection and index it.
\\
\\
\begin{boxedverbatim}

lines_to_docs.pl --input 11sent.txt --output 11sent_source
directory_to_corpus.pl --corpus 11Sent --base 11sent_produced \
 --directory 11sent_source
index_corpus.pl --corpus 11Sent --base 11sent_produced

\end{boxedverbatim}
\\
\\
Next, we can directly use the utility to stem the corpus create a lexical network, \emph{11sent.graph}:
\\
\\
\begin{boxedverbatim}
corpus_to_lexical_network.pl -c 11Sent -b 11sent_produced \
 -o 11sent.graph --stem --verbose
\end{boxedverbatim}
\\
\\
Now, our output file, \emph{11sent.graph} contains a lexical network of stemmed terms.
