INTRODUCTION

The University of Michigan's CLAIR (Computational Linguistics And
Information Retrieval) group is happy to present version 1.07 of
clairlib, the Clair library.

The Clair library is intended to simplify a number of generic tasks in
Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and
Network Analysis. Its architecture also allows for external software
to be plugged in with very little effort.

Two distributions of the Clair library are available: Clairlib-core,
with essential functionality and minimal dependence on external
software, and Clairlib-ext, with extended functionality that may be of
interest to a smaller audience.  Work is underway on Clairlib-bio and
Clairlib-polisci, extensions that will be of interest to people
working on Bioinformatics and Political Science.

FUNCTIONALITY

Native in Clairlib-core: Tokenization, Summarization, LexRank, Biased
LexRank, Document Clustering, Document Indexing, PageRank, Biased
PageRank, Web Graph Analysis, Network Generation, Power Law
Distribution Analysis, Network Analysis (clustering coefficient,
degree distribution plotting, average shortest path, diameter,
triangles, shortest path matrices, connected components), Cosine
Similarity, Random Walks on Graphs, Statistics (distributions, tests),
Tf, Idf, Community Finding*, Phrase-Based Queries*, Fuzzy OR Queries*

Imported functionality into Clairlib-core: Stemming, Sentence
Segmentation, Web Page Download, Web Crawling, XML Parsing, XML Tree
Building, XML Writing

Clairlib-ext features: Sentence Segmentation using MxTerminator,
Sentence Parsing using the Charniak Parser and Chunklink

* New and expanded functionality available this latest release


CHANGES

       1.07 Jun 2009
       * Added Clair::Network::Spectral for spectral partitioning using Fiedler Vector.
       * Made Clairlib independent of MEAD (MEAD is no more required for Clairlib).
       * Added Naive Bayes learning and classification.
       * Added tests for feature extraction, learning, classification.
       * Fixed a bug in Clair::Cluster::create_lexical_network().
       * Added sampling options to Clair::Cluster.
       * Added "No IDF" option and sampling capabilities to corpus_to_cos.pl utility.
       * Fixed documentation typos.
       * Added new tutorials to the documentation.
       * Fixed bug in Clair::Utils::CorpusDownload.
       * Added 'manual weights' option to make_synth_collection utility.
