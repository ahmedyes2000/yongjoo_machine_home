<HTML>    KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia AP  A key police witness in the Anwar Ibrahim trial told the court Tuesday that he had tried and failed to win business favors from the former deputy prime minister but that was not why he was testifying against him.    The former police intelligence officer Amir Junos took the witness stand as the trial stumbled along amid the three-month jail sentence for a defense lawyer held in contempt of court.    The lawyer Zainur Zakaria who won a reprieve from a higher court that stayed his imprisonment pending an appeal hearing Friday was present in the court Tuesday.    Judge Augustine Paul handed down the sentence Monday after Zainur refused to apologize for an affidavit he had filed on behalf of Anwar seeking the removal of two prosecutors on grounds that they were allegedly fabricating evidence.    Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 two weeks after he was fired as deputy prime minister and finance minister. His subsequent jailing and beating while in custody has attracted international concern over the case.    Anwar is being tried on four counts of corruption. He will be tried on another corruption count as well as five counts of sexual misconduct at a later date.    Anwar denies the charges calling them part of a political vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.    Monday's sideshow interrupted the main trial when a stumped defense team asked for an adjournment to recover from the blow.    Resuming Tuesday to defend Anwar against allegations that he abused his power to cover up alleged sexual misdeeds lawyer Christopher Fernando asked Amir whether he held a grudge against Anwar because his request had been denied.    ``I have no intent to come to the court and exaggerate and embellish my testimony in an effort to embarrass Anwar'' he said.    He had earlier admitted during cross-examination to asking Anwar for equity in a securities firm and business deals for his friends.    Amir was called as a witness by the prosecution to prove allegations that Anwar had directed the police to harass and intimidate two people who had alleged that Anwar had sex with his secretary's wife and had sodomized his chauffeur.

<HTML>    HONG KONG AP  Hong Kong needs to cut fees at its new airport to maintain the territory's position as a regional air hub after business rival Singapore slashed airport landing fees last week the chairman of Hong Kong's flag carrier said Tuesday.    The request came a day after leading aircraft maintenance company Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering sacked 352 employees or 8 percent of its staff citing soaring operation costs at the newly opened Cheek Lap Kok airport.    Speaking at a business gathering Peter Sutch chairman of Cathay Pacific Airways and Swire Pacific Ltd. said Hong Kong risks losing its competitiveness unless the government and Airport Authority cut fees even though it still has an important edge in terms of its geographic location.    ``Unless we get our cost base right we'll lose our position to other hubs in the region'' Sutch said.    Singapore's Civil Aviation Authority on Friday said it will cut aircraft landing fees at Changi Airport by 10 percent for a year beginning Jan. 1 as part of the government's package to reduce the cost of doing business in the city-state.    By bringing the fees to about the level in 1981 when the airport was first opened airlines will be able to save about dlrs 11 million the authority said.    Hong Kong's Airport Authority created a furor last year when it set landing and usage fees at Hong Kong's new airport which opened in early July at levels well above those at the old Kai Tak Airport. It later lowered the fees but they remain higher than those that had been charged at Kai Tak.    The aircraft maintenance company said Monday it needed to cut staff partly due to the extra costs of 50 million Hong Kong dollars U.S. dlrs 6.4 million in rent at the new airport and 15 million Hong Kong dollars U.S. dlrs 1.9 million in royalties paid to the Airport Authority the South China Morning Post reported.    ``We're not blaming the Airport Authority  the issue of charges at Chek Lap Kok is ongoing. It's certainly one of the most expensive airports to operate from in the world'' commercial director John Paterson was quoted as saying.    Swire Pacific has the controlling stake in both Cathay Pacific and the maintenance company.

<HTML>    ARLINGTON Texas AP  Rafael Palmeiro is coming back to Texas.    The free agent first baseman and the Rangers agreed to a dlrs 45 million five-year contract on Tuesday five years after Texas signed Will Clark and let Palmeiro go to Baltimore.    Palmeiro who played for Texas from 1989-93 was a fan favorite in during his first stint in Arlington.    Palmeiro who had just finished his best season in Texas with a .295 average 37 homers and 105 RBIs flourished with the Orioles. He hit .296 this year with 43 homers and 121 RBIs leading Baltimore in homers hits 183 and RBIs.    His return to Texas gives the Rangers something they have sorely lacked  power from the left side of the plate. Palmeiro will be able to take advantage of the short left-field porch at The Ballpark.    Baltimore had been eager to bring Palmeiro back. The Orioles who signed Albert Belle to a dlrs 65 million five-year contract Tuesday also have lost Roberto Alomar Eric Davis and Alan Mills to free agency.

<HTML>    WASHINGTON AP  Ice rink spectators may want to think twice before giving a round of applause to the guy driving the colorful ice resurfacing machine. His work may be hazardous to their health.    A study by Harvard University researchers concludes that gasoline- and propane-powered ice surfacing machines may produce hazardous levels of nitrogen dioxide in rinks.    It's sort of like running your car in the garage said Jonathan I. Levy one of the researchers. ``If you leave the engine on in the garage for a period of time you know that the pollution levels rise. Obviously an ice rink is larger ... but it is a similar idea.''    The solution is increased ventilation. ``Basically ventilation levels in ice rinks tend to be not that high because if you bring in too much outside air you have trouble keeping ice quality'' Levy said.    The resurfacing machines are best known by their brand names such as Zamboni Olympia and others. They smooth the ice and spread a film of water that quickly freezes improving the surface between periods of hockey games and in the intermissions at ice shows.    The increased levels of nitrogen dioxide immediately after the machines operate have led to reports of respiratory problems including coughing tightness of the chest and shortness of breath the researchers said.    In one case a group of Minnesota hockey players had breathing problems a half hour after the ice was resurfaced.    ``The jury is out'' as to whether there is long-term damage Levy said. His research was reported in the December edition of the American Journal of Public Health.    There is some evidence that chronic exposure to high levels of nitrogen dioxide leads to a greater risk of respiratory infection in children and worsens asthma symptoms'' Levy said in an interview.    The researchers studied 19 ice rinks in the Boston area for three years and found that rinks with propane-powered ice resurfacing machines had average nitrogen dioxide concentrations of 206 parts per billion. The average was 132 parts per billion for rinks with gasoline machines and 37 ppb for those with electric machines.    Studies have found increased levels of respiratory illness in people with chronic exposure to 100 ppb of the gas the researchers said.    Using electric ice resurfacing machines can also help solve the problem but buying a new machine can cost up to dlrs 100000 Levy said so the more practical answer may be better ventilation as well as making sure the machines are tuned to reduce emissions.

<HTML>    DUBAI United Arab Emirates AP  The United Arab Emirates is allowing entry to foreigners who have visited Israel an immigration official said Tuesday.    The Emirates began permitting foreigners with Israeli visa stamps in their passports to enter the country about three months ago under orders from the Interior Ministry the official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.    Most Arab countries including the United Arab Emirates do not have diplomatic relations with Israel and for years did not allow entry to anyone who had visited the Jewish state.    In recent years Oman and Qatar established low-level trade relations with Israel and began allowing Israelis  as well as foreigners with Israeli visa stamps  to enter.    Kuwait allows British U.S. and French citizens to enter if they have Israeli visas in their passports and evaluates others on a case-by-case basis an immigration official at the airport said.    The other Arab Gulf states  Bahrain and Saudi Arabia  ban entry to anyone with an Israeli visa stamp.    Egypt and Jordan which have peace treaties with Israel and some North African nations also allow Israeli visitors as well as foreigners who have visited the Jewish state.

<HTML>    BANGKOK Thailand AP  The Thai government and the International Monetary Fund have agreed on a forecast of 1 percent economic growth for Thailand next year after this year's 7 percent contraction in gross domestic product a Cabinet minister said Tuesday.    The projection came as the Cabinet approved a letter of intent outlining economic and policy targets legislative reforms public works and social development programs to which it will commit itself in the upcoming sixth quarter of a dlrs 17.2 billion IMF rescue package.    The return to growth will come slowly as a contraction of 3.3 percent has been forecast for the first quarter of 1999 followed by mild 0.2 percent growth in the second quarter.    Pitak Intrawityanunt a minister of the Prime Minister's Office said the letter of intent will allow for a public sector deficit equivalent to 5 percent of gross domestic product to stimulate stagnant domestic demand.    It also calls for speedy progress in recapitalizing the banking sector and passage of a rack of economic reform legislation currently stuck in Parliament.    Pitak said the government budget deficit currently accounts for 3 percent of GDP and the state enterprise investment budget totals 2 percent.    The IMF had earlier insisted on more stringent restraints on public spending which critics said were hindering economic recovery.    The Thai government has made five out of a scheduled 12 withdrawals from the IMF package totaling dlrs 11.95 billion.    Once the IMF board in Washington approves the draft letter of intent Thailand will be eligible to draw another dlrs 480 million in the sixth quarter of the IMF program.    Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai told reporters at a press conference after the Cabinet meeting the country will see renewed economic growth by the second half of 1999.    The new letter of intent will respond with a sharper focus on rural development and steps towards decentralization of budgetary powers an Asian Development Bank official told Dow Jones Newswires.    ADB and World Bank programs funded through the IMF credit line possibly to be supplemented by additional funds from Japan are to pump hundreds of millions of dollars over the next few years into rural infrastructure worker training and agricultural research and assistance programs.    Thailand plans to spend 1 percent of its GDP on social safety net and related labor-intensive investment projects according to the letter of intent signed by Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda and addressed to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus.    ``As far as possible these projects will be foreign financed'' the letter said.    The recapitalization and restructuring of a financial sector buried in more than 2 trillion baht dlrs 55 billion worth of non-performing loans remains a centerpiece of the IMF program.    ``By the end of January next year the central bank will complete the next round of negotiations with all banks and finance companies to ensure that they remain fully capitalized during the six month period through June'' the letter said.    Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul told the press conference he expects to be able to reach agreement with all financial institutions by the deadline.    Analysts are concerned that financially-weak medium-sized commercial banks are being given too much time to raise funds delaying the renewed credit extension that is needed along with domestic consumption to revive production.

<HTML>    LONDON AP  England full-back Matt Perry has been ruled out of Saturday's rugby union Test against South Africa at Twickenham.    Perry suffered a concussion during last weekend's defeat against Australia and will be sidelined for three weeks England coach Clive Woodward said Tuesday.    With Paul Grayson and Will Greenwood still questionable with injuries Woodward called up David Rees and Alex King into the squad to provide cover at wing and fly-half.    Perry was injured in the final seconds of the 12-11 defeat against the Wallabies at Twickenham. Doctors said he should take off at least three weeks.    Grayson who limped off with a knee injury against the Aussies and center Greenwood who failed to make the match are still under treatment.    Perry's absence could clear the way for in-form Northampton full-back Nick Beal to take over although Woodward won't be making any further announcements until Thursday.    Mike Catt who last played for England against France last February could also be considered at full-back.    Scrum-half Kyran Bracken will also miss the Springboks clash due to injury meaning a chance for Matt Dawson. Fly-half Jonny Wilkinson is out with fitness problems.    Rees who only recently returned to action after suffering a serious groin injury last season will strongly challenge wing incumbents Tony Underwood and Austin Healey.    Rees hasn't played for England since the Five Nations Championship earlier this year while King is set to pressure Catt as a possible replacement for number 10 and goalkicker Paul Grayson.    The South Africa Springboks will set a world record of 18 consecutive Test victories if they beat England on Saturday. They would eclipse the New Zealand All Blacks' 17-match winning streak between 1965 and 1969.    ``I don't see any country going through a winning run of 17 or 18 Tests in the future'' Springboks coach Nick Mallett said.    sw

<HTML>    SARAJEVO Bosnia-Herzegovina AP  A shipment of nine million newly minted coins reached Bosnia on Tuesday to replace chewing gum and chocolate bars as the country's loose change.    The coins made by London's Royal Mint are the first to reach Bosnia since the summer when the country introduced a new currency the Konvertibilna Marka. The currency valued at one German Mark or about 63 cents had been issued only in bank notes until now.    Due to the lack of coinage Bosnian shops use chewing gum as ersatz 10 Fening coins and small chocolate bars to replace 20 Fening coins. There are 100 Fenings to the Marka.    ``We will waste no time putting the coins into circulation ... so that people can feel them jingling in their pockets'' said Peter Nicholl the governor of Bosnia's Central Bank. ``A sound that symbolizes a solid future built on a sound currency.''    The 10 20 and 50 Fening coins are to be put into general circulation this month.    While shops had given chewing gum and chocolate bars as small change they refused to accept them as payment for goods. Many customers have been left with large candy stashes.    Bosnia's market used up to four different currencies until this summer when the Kovertibilna Marka was launched.    The Bosnian Serbs used the Yugoslav Dinar the Bosnian Croats the Croatian Kuna and the central Muslim-dominated parts their own money. The German Mark remains accepted everywhere.

<HTML>    ALBUQUERQUE AP  Mayor Jim Baca says Lucy is the first visitor he's ever had who was content to munch on an old running shoe.    The mayor on Monday met the 10-week-old Bengal tiger cub who along with another Bengal cub 6-month-old Scout are on loan for a year to the Rio Grande Zoo.    For right now Lucy is being hand-raised by keeper Linda McNatt until she's big enough to defend herself from Scout.    The playful cub was a hit at Baca's 11th floor City Hall office where she sat calmly on his lap to have her photo taken while Baca's staff ooohed and aahed from afar. She also romped through the office gnawing on an old tennis shoe.    ``I love tigers'' the mayor said. ``They're such magnificent animals.''    Lucy also seemed to take to him.    ``She hasn't been that calm with anybody'' said Kent Newton assistant zoo director.    Lucy is earning her keep as an ambassador for her kind in the wild.    ``It's good to use her for educational purposes because people really do pay attention when you walk in the room with a tiger'' McNatt said.    The cub is not on exhibit yet but Scout is occupying an area where the zoo once had white Bengal tigers. The white tigers recently were sent to Wildlife World Zoo outside of Phoenix.    ``They were a pleasure for the public to see when we first brought them in but that excitement has waned'' Newton said.    White Bengals also aren't as valuable genetically because they are a genetic anomaly and somewhat inbred he said.    When the Bengal cubs leave the zoo hopes to bring in endangered Amur tigers also known as Siberian tigers for breeding. There are only about 440 to 500 Amur tigers left in the wild in two or three populations in their natural range of far eastern Russia and northeastern China.    ``Siberian tigers are critically endangered so there is a need to breed them in captivity as a hedge against extinction'' Newton said.    ``They're beautiful and huge and wonderful for the people to see but in addition we will be contributing to the preservation of that species'' he said.

<HTML>    DIYARBAKIR Turkey AP  An 18-year-old woman set off a hand grenade strapped to her body Tuesday in a busy shopping street killing herself and injuring nine people said the governor of this province in the heart of the 14-year-old Kurdish war for autonomy.    Nafiz Kayali governor of Diyarbakir province refused to say whether the woman was a Kurdish rebel Anatolia a Turkish news agency reported.    Female Kurdish militants have in the past carried out suicide bomb attacks in Turkey.    The blast occurred in the town of Lice in southeastern Turkey.    Private television NTV reported that one of the injured was a soldier.    The attack could discredit claims by rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan who was detained in Rome last month that the group is renouncing violence in the struggle for autonomy for Kurds.    Last month a Kurdish woman died setting off a bomb near a military garrison that wounded two others.    The Turkish army is currently conducting a large-scale operation against the rebels in southeast Turkey and neighboring northern Iraq NTV reported.    The army intensified its operations sending in warplanes to bomb rebel hideouts following the downing of a military helicopter by the rebels Friday NTV said. Sixteen soldiers were killed in the crash.    Despite Ocalan's call for a cease-fire on Sept. 1 PKK rebels had been carried out close to 200 operations the Germany-based pro-Kurdish news agency DEM said.    DEM also claimed that the Turkish forces had burned down 36 villages populated mainly by Kurds in the past three months.    The military have in the past been accused of destroying villages that allegedly harbored rebel forces.    Close to 37000 people have been killed since Ocalan's group began fighting in 1984.    sf-ht-fd

<HTML>    BONN Germany AP  German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine said Tuesday he will seek approval from Canada and the United States for having European common currency nations represented at Group of Seven meetings.    Lafontaine who leaves Thursday for a two-day trip to North America said the 11 countries adopting the euro common currency on Jan. 1 should be represented by the finance minister of whichever country holds the rotating European Union presidency.    As Germany assumes the six-month presidency Jan. 1 Lafontaine himself would be the first European currency zone representative if his plan is approved.    Lafontaine is to arrive Thursday in Canada for a meeting with Finance Minister Paul Martin in Ottawa before traveling to Washington.    On Friday he is to meet separately with U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michael Camdessus and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.    His trip to North America part of a series of introductory visits since taking office on Oct. 27 will mean the finance minister has visited all of the Group of Seven Leading Industrialized Nations except Japan.    aet/cb

<HTML>    ATLANTA AP  Otis Nixon returned to the Atlanta Braves on Tuesday agreeing to a one-year contract that finally gives the team a true leadoff hitter.    The Braves also re-signed shortstop Ozzie Guillen to a two-year deal providing depth behind injury-plagued Walt Weiss.    Weiss was the Braves' leadoff hitter most of last season inheriting the role almost by default after the team failed to re-sign Kenny Lofton. Weiss started in the All-Star game and had a .386 on-base percentage but he lacks speed only seven stolen bases and chronic leg injuries limited him to 96 games.    Nixon an outfielder who played for the Braves from 1991-93 was still an effective player at age 39. This year he hit .297 for the Minnesota Twins  matching his career high  and was eighth in the American League with 37 stolen bases.    Nixon was one of the most popular Braves during his three-year stint in Atlanta despite a 60-day suspension for cocaine use that kept him out of the 1991 postseason and the first three weeks of the '92 season.    Before his suspension he set a modern franchise record with 72 steals and hit .297. He re-signed with the Braves the following season after becoming a free agent and hit .294 with 41 steals sharing playing time in center field with Deion Sanders.    The Braves have a crowded outfield also signing free agent Brian Jordan last week to go with returnees Ryan Klesko Andruw Jones and Gerald Williams.    Schuerholz said the signing of Nixon and the emergence of top prospect George Lombard doesn't necessarily signal another move in the outfield. Klesko would be the most likely candidate for a trade coming off a sub-par season .274 18 homers 70 RBIs and scheduled to make dlrs 17 million over the next three years.    Guillen 34 joined the Braves in May after being waived by the Baltimore Orioles. He revitalized his career hitting .277 with one homer and 22 RBIs in 83 games.

<HTML>    JAKARTA Indonesia AP  Sporadic rioting rising crime and continued student protests have worsened a retail slump in Indonesia according to the Indonesian Retailers' Association.    The increasingly uncertain situation on Jakarta's streets has resulted in many people leaving work earlier and reduced the likelihood of night shopping once a favorite pastime among affluent Jakarta residents.    ``I think some of the retailers also feel very much that their volumes will go down'' association chairman Steve Sondakh told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview released Tuesday.    ``They are naturally going to shorten their operating hours'' said Sondahk who is also a direct of the Hero supermarket chain one of Indonesia's biggest retail groups.    Consumer activity has already been hit by a deep recession caused by Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years.    Sondakh said retail sales on average have already fallen between 30 percent and 40 percent from a year ago with the electronics sector being the hardest hit. Sales there are down an estimated 60 percent.    The rise in lawlessness which has grown out of the unrest on the streets is also adding to retailers' woes. Crime has steadily increased in Jakarta with several foreign embassies advising their citizens to avoid the city of 11 million altogether.

<HTML>    SARAJEVO Bosnia-Herzegovina AP  A shipment of nine million newly minted coins reached Bosnia Tuesday to replace chewing gum and chocolate bars as the country's loose change.    The coins hot from London's Royal Mint are the first to reach Bosnia since the summer when the country introduced a new currency theKonvertibilna Marka. The currency valued at one German Mark dlrs 0.63 was issued only in bank notes until now.    Due to the lack of coinage Bosnian shops use chewing gum as ersatz 10 Fencing coins and small chocolate bars to replace coins of 20 Fineness. There are 100 Fineness to theMarka    ``We will waste no time in putting the coins into circulation ... so that people can feel them jingling in their pockets'' said Peter Nickel the governor of Bosnia's Central Bank. ``A sound that symbolizes a solid future built on a sound currency.''    The first coin shipment totals 936000 Konvertibilna Marka.    The 10 20 and 50 Fening coins are to be put into general circulation in December.    While shops had given chewing gum and chocolate bars as small change they refused to accept them as payment for goods. Many customers are left with large candy stashes.    Bosnia's market used four different currencies up until this summer when the Kovertibilna Marka was launched. The Bosnian Serbs used the Yugoslav Dinar the Bosnian Croats the Croatian Kuna and the central Muslim-dominated parts their own money. The German Mark remains accepted everywhere.    acr/amb/gj

<HTML>    KUPANG Indonesia AP  Christian mobs burned two houses a car and a motorcycle Tuesday on the second day of unrest in a provincial capital of Indonesia where rioters burned and ransacked 15 mosques.    In a separate outburst of religious violence Muslim crowds hurled stones at two homes used for Christian worship as well as a shop and a cinema on Java Indonesia's main island.    The riots raised fears that tit-for-tat attacks on places of worship will escalate in the world's most populous Muslim nation which is already enduring severe economic and political turmoil.    ``We condemn all burning of houses of God'' President B.J. Habibie said Tuesday. ``We condemn it whether it is the burning of churches or mosques or Buddhist temples or whatever.''    On Tuesday frightened Muslims with sickles and swords guarded their homes and mosques in the Christian-dominated city of Kupang the capital of East Nusa Tenggara province.    Thousands of people many of them armed roamed the streets and attacked several buildings. However heavy rain doused fires set by arsonists and the military reported calm by the afternoon.    Most shops were shut and there was no public transport. Residents swept up debris from the rioting.    ``I feel very sad and shocked'' said Kamtina Ibrahim a 26-year-old Muslim woman standing in front of the main mosque in the city of 120000. Stone-throwing rioters had shoved in the doors and shattered most of the windows.    The attacks on Kupang's mosques on Monday were in retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim mobs in Jakarta on Nov. 22 when 14 people were killed some hacked to death.    In apparent revenge mobs early Tuesday smashed windows of two private houses where Christians worshipped in Banjarsari 155 miles 250 kilometers southeast of Jakarta police and witnesses said.    They denied earlier reports by the military that the two houses had been burned.    About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims with the rest following Christian Hindu Buddhist or other faiths. Some cities in the sprawling archipelago nation have Christian majorities.    Many army reinforcements had rushed to Kupang from the nearby territory of East Timor where separatist rebels have been fighting the Indonesian military since 1975.    Police said they had detained alleged instigators of the riots the official Antara news agency reported. Authorities did not say how many people were being questioned.    Muhammad Djaffar chairman of the local mosque council said 15 mosques were burned or vandalized Monday in Kupang 1875 kilometers 1172 miles southeast of Jakarta.    Crowds also burned down a market a Muslim school and a hostel for Islamic pilgrims. Several other small places of Islamic worship as well as dozens of shops were also set on fire.    Djaffar criticized the security forces saying they reacted slowly to the unrest and showed little desire to confront the mobs. There were no reports of arrests.    The military its credibility sagging because of its involvement in human rights abuses has been overstretched as it tries to keep order in the turbulent Southeast Asian nation.    Four mosques were burned and 13 people were injured said F.K. Lerik the Protestant mayor of Kupang. Air services to Kupang were canceled Tuesday because of security concerns.    Hoping to cool tensions Kupang's Roman Catholic Bishop Petrus Turang apologized for the burnings. Islamic leaders across the nation urged their followers not to retaliate with more violence.    Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the national philosophy known as Pancasila adopted when Indonesia declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.    The upsurge in religious violence follows months of riots and protests in many parts of Indonesia.    Social tensions in Indonesia fueled by widespread unemployment have intensified amid the worst economic crisis in decades.    There is also political turmoil as students protesters demand greater democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule by former President Suharto who was forced to quit following deadly riots in May.

<HTML>    LONDON AP  The Football Association said Tuesday it hoped to resolve financial misconduct charges early next year against Premier League club Nottingham Forest.    Charges against former manager Brian Clough were dropped three months ago but similar charges of unauthorized payments in transfer deals made in the late 1980 and early '90s are still hanging over other club officials.    Forest chief executive Phil Soar said Tuesday it was ``an absolute disgrace'' the charges brought 11 months ago were unresolved.    ``It is a complex case and we are at present awaiting legal advice on an important piece of evidence'' an FA spokesman said.     QC;     LEICESTER England AP  Leicester manager Martin O'Neill still hasn't signed a new contract and admits his days could be numbered.    In October Leicester offered O'Neill a lucrative new contract to stave off a bid from Leeds. At the time Leicester officials denied O'Neill permission to talk with Leeds.    O'Neill now says he is only being ``tolerated'' by the club board which he says has been interfering in on-the-pitch matters.    ``I want to run the football club the way I see fit'' O'Neill said Tuesday. ``I know more about football than the people on the board so I'll live and die by the results.''    Leicester is in 13th place 11 points behind leaders Aston Villa.     QC;     BLACKBURN England AP  Last-place Blackburn Rovers is rumored to be looking at a long list of choices to replace Roy Hodgson who was fired as manager last month.    The list is reported to include ex-Liverpool coach Roy Evans Graeme Souness of Portugal's Benfica and Manchester United assistant Brian Kidd.    Manchester United has blocked Blackburn's attempt to talk with Kidd.    Scottish international Colin Hendry was voted by Blackburn fans as their choice to follow Hodgson. But Hendry says he's staying with Glasgow Rangers quashing rumors he could return as player-manager.    ``My playing career carries on at Rangers'' he said Tuesday. ``I'm happy here and that's the end of the story. As far as I'm concerned by future and my career are at Rangers.''     QC;     NEWCASTLE England AP  David Batty trained Tuesday with Newcastle with a disagreement over his transfer fee holding up his move to back to Leeds.    Batty last week asked Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit for a transfer to Leeds  his hometown. Leeds is reported to have offered 4 million pounds dlrs 6.6 million with Newcastle asking for 6 million pounds dlrs 10 million.    ``Without revealing how much we think he is worth I would say 4 million is nowhere near enough'' said Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd.    Batty still lives with his family in Leeds and says he'd like to return to the club.    scw

<HTML>    BEIJING AP  China on Tuesday called for the immediate release of 20 Chinese fishermen arrested by a Philippine navy patrol near the disputed Spratly Islands.    The Chinese government is very concerned views the detentions as illegal and wants Manila to take measures to avoid such arrests in the future Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said at a twice-weekly briefing.    The Philippine patrol arrested 20 Chinese fishermen and seized their six boats on Sunday near the Alicia Annie Reef which is claimed by both the Philippines and China.

Romulo Gualdrapa said Monday they were arrested for illegally fishing in Philippine territory and using sodium cyanide to catch fish in violation of a Philippine law that bans the practice.    Cyanide is added to sea water by some fishermen to stun fish so they can be caught and sold alive to restaurants. Cyanide kills many other fish and destroys coral reefs.    In Manila Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the Chinese fishermen's mother ship refused to stop and headed for the Mischief Reef part of the Spratly Islands.    ``So it appears that Mischief Reef is now becoming a haven of these illegal fishermen'' Mercado said.    Presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the Chinese fishermen will be released.    ``They will be detained for a short period. They will lectured to about not violating the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines and then after an appropriate time they will be let off'' he said.    The arrests were the latest in a series of recent incidents between Manila and Beijing over territories in the South China Sea.    The Spratlys are believed to be rich in oil gas and minerals. China Vietnam and Taiwan claim all of the Spratlys while the Philippines Malaysia and Brunei claim parts of the chain.

<HTML>    CAIRO Egypt AP  Using magnetic sensors and computers Egyptian experts have located and mapped an important pharaonic city in the Nile Delta officials said Tuesday.    Ahmed Gouda Husain of the Geophysical Research Center said the experts have been able to create detailed images of Qantir which was a capital of one of Egypt's most famous kings Ramses II.    Ramses II a pharaoh in the so-called New Kingdom era ruled Egypt from 1304 to 1237 B.C.    ``It's a complete town with all its palaces houses streets and stables'' Husain told The Associated Press.    Husain said the team he heads has been using magnetic sensors to survey the city which also served as the capital of the Hyksos invaders for nearly 100 years.    He said surveying the city  covering a square kilometer half square-mile of cotton corn and wheat fields  took about 45 days.    The team used specialized equipment to measure electric impulses and magnetic levels Husain said.    Husain a geophysicist who has worked in archaeology for 15 years said the team later put the readings into a computer to generate images of the city.    Qantir 75 miles 120 kilometers north of Cairo is covered with sandy mounds that archaeologists believe cover a number of pharaonic sites.    Gaballah Ali Gaballah head of Egypt's Supreme Council for Antiquities said the site would require at least 20 years of excavations to unearth the main sections of the city.    Husain said his team has used high-tech equipment to make a number of important archaeological discoveries in Egypt.    In Sohag for example they found tombs and 12 buried solar boats designed to carry the dead in their afterlives.

<HTML>    ROTTERDAM Netherlands AP  The crooked skeleton with the gap-toothed grin is waiting at the back of the dimly lit gallery. To reach him you have to pass the fetuses of Siamese twins eternally joined at the chest and floating in a jar of formaldehyde.    ``Whoa! That's gross'' 15-year-old Timon Kuijkhoven squealed as he came upon a deformed baby with a single eye in another bottle.    Kuijkhoven was among dozens of visitors one day last week touring ``Up to the Bare Bones'' an exhibition of human remains that has transformed the Kunsthal gallery into one macabre museum.    Curator Wim Pijbes denies he's running a little shop of horrors. Instead he says the exhibition aims to show the public how and why the remains ended up in a display case.    Most people don't appear to care why. They're only interested in gazing with a mixture of subdued horror and morbid fascination at the gruesome exhibits.    ``Oh no it's an arm'' gasped another visitor Antje Smits Schoon as she peered into a bottle holding what at first glance looks like a thick sausage.    In fact it's the arm and hand of a 3-year-old child preserved in formaldehyde and for an unexplained reason clutching a leaf.    ``The exhibit'' Smits Schoon declared ``is pretty weird.''    Articles on display include deformed fetuses and skeletons religious relics and works of art fashioned from human hair.    There's even the salt-cured tongue of a 17th century Dutch traitor held in a little glass-topped coffin along with one of his brother's toes.    The traitors Johan and Cornelis de Witt were killed by an angry mob in The Hague in 1672. Shortly after their deaths other bits of their bodies made the rounds of Dutch cafes where the regulars checked them out over their foaming beers.    The Kunsthal exhibit causing the biggest sensation is the leathery remains of an Inuit fished out of icy waters near Greenland by Dutch sailors 200 years ago.    Greenland's premier Jonathan Motzfeldt has asked the museum to take the body off display and return it to Greenland for burial. ``It could be the great-grandfather of someone up here'' he told Danish television this week.    Pijbes has refused saying museums all over Europe have similar bodies on display.    Meanwhile the Inuit  its torso loosely stitched together and missing its face  lies in a glass display case next to a mummified Dutch girl who was dug out of a peat bog.    Many of these remains were collected as curiosities by 17th century Dutch scientists. Others have religious significance while some like the pair of underpants woven out of human hair have been created in the name of art.    But the bottled remains are the stars of this show.    ``Check this out. You can see its brain'' Kuijkhoven said pointing at a baby's head with half the skull cut away.    ``It's a bit macabre. I don't really like it.''    With that he went over to look at the crooked skeleton.

<HTML>    ADELAIDE Australia AP  The South Australian government will explore opportunities in the Philippines that could involve water management in provincial cities South Australian state Premier John Olsen said Tuesday.    Olsen who met with former Philippines president Fidel Ramos said water management was a key focus for the South Australian government and one in which it had the expertise to help the Philippines.    ``There are 15 cities with a population of 1 million people in the Philippines -- and Mr. Ramos today indicated to me that there are opportunities for South Australia to become involved in water management in those areas'' Olsen said.    Olsen said a delegation of South Australia's Water Corp. directors and executives are visiting the region this week.    ``The delegation will review first hand both the progress that has been made to date in projects and key prospects in key international markets -- which include the Philippines Indonesia and China'' he said.    pjs

<HTML>    FRANKFURT Germany AP  With economic growth faltering the core council of Europe's future central bank meets Tuesday under increasing pressure to spell out its policies before launching the euro currency on Jan. 1.    The European Central Bank begins setting monetary policy including interest rates for the 11 euro nations as soon as the currency is launched.    Analysts say the bank has a tough job ahead with Europe's economy weakened by lower demand in Asia for a range of goods and services and by Russia's financial crisis. Manufacturing orders are down. If prices begin to sink as growth falls then recession is possible some analysts believe.    ``It's a much more difficult situation than we all thought some time ago. Inflation is certainly no problem. Right now everybody is very much afraid of deflation'' said Adolf Rosenstock economist at Nomura.    Europe's new interest rate will be a key issue in the closed-door talks. The rate is likely to be at or near Germany's 3.3 percent though there is speculation it could drop to 3 percent.    Although the bank is independent it has come under steady political pressure from Germany to keep interest rates low to boost economies and help governments cut unemployment standing Europe-wide at 9.9 percent.    The bank says its job is to keep inflation low and prices steady not to tinker with monetary policy to achieve broader economic goals. But pressure only grew Tuesday as leaders of Germany and France agreed to strengthen efforts to fight unemployment and boost the economy.    Another major issue is how the central bank will assess money supply a key element in deciding future interest rate policy.    The governing council of the European Central Bank consists of 11 central bank chiefs from the European Union countries launching the euro plus a Frankfurt-based directorate of six that includes bank President Wim Duisenberg.    dkt-aet

<HTML>    YAOUNDE Cameroon AP  Customs inspectors at Cameroon's main international airport seized 11 elephant tusks from two Chinese businessmen the chief customs officer said Tuesday.    The ivory tusks were discovered in the bags of the two men who were detained briefly and then permitted to travel onward from Cameroon's main commercial hub of Douala to Paris on Tuesday.    There is a worldwide ban on the sale and export of ivory although penalties for violators vary significantly from country to country.    In an unrelated incident a Nigerian man was arrested and charged with drug smuggling after he was found with sealed capsules of heroin in his stomach.    The heroin worth several thousand dollars was destined for Nigeria said Chief Customs Inspector Joseph Moulela.    The Nigerian John Chukwudi Amobi could face up to 10 years in jail if convicted in a Cameroonian court on drug smuggling charges.    Douala has become a transit point for drug shipments that ultimately head to Europe Douala International Airport Commandant Fabien Mballa Toulou.    In recent weeks concealed packages of heroin destined for Douala have been seized in the Pakistani port city of Karachi he said.    et/ids/tjs

<HTML>    TURIN Italy AP  Juventus top manager Luciano Moggi on Tuesday defended as ``well grounded'' the club decision to stay a single day in Istanbul for the politically tinged Champions League match against Turkey's Galatasaray.    The Italian league champions who need a victory against the Turkish team to keep qualifying chances alive in the most titled European soccer competition decided to travel to Istanbul on the match day Wednesday and return home immediately after the game.    UEFA Europe's soccer governing body which requires teams to arrive the day before of European Cup matches was critical of Juventus decision.    ``Juventus feels there are well grounded motives for failing to conform to UEFA directives'' said Moggi the general director of the Turin team which is owned by the Agnelli family of auto tycoons.    Juventus confirmed on Tuesday its travel plans for the match already postponed by one week after Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader prompted anti-Italian demonstrations in Turkey.    Several Juventus players who had initially refused to travel to Instanbul bowed to the club decision to play Galatasaray but criticized the UEFA stand.    ``We have been forced to play a game conditioned by political motives'' said No.1 keeper Angelo Peruzzi.    Team captain Antonio Conte said Tuesday that the Italian government and UEFA left the Italian team alone.    ``UEFA and the Italian government have claimed that there are no secutiry problems in Istanbul ... but as far as we know no UEFA and government representatives will be in Istanbul Wednesday'' Conte told the Italian news agency ANSA.    Italian culture minister Giovanna Malendri invited to attend the game by her Turkish counterpart said Tuesday she had not yet taken a final decision about traveling to Istanbul.  UR; pv

<HTML>    A summary of financial and business news from The Associated Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and move on this circuit in expanded form:    HONG KONG AP  Most Asian stock markets closed sharply lower Tuesday on the back of Wall Street's 2.3 percent decline with the key index in Hong Kong tumbling for a third straight session. Hong Kong's blue chip Hang Seng Index plummeted 4.1 percent or 426.47 points to close at 9975.85 below the psychologically important level of 10000 points. The market has shed 7.1 percent since Friday when Hong Kong announced its gross domestic product fell by 7 percent in the third quarter. Since then two major companies  Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company and Citibank  announced layoffs and the government hinted at a budget deficit for the second year. Singapore shares also tumbled 3.4 percent or 47.85 points to close at 1368.70. In Tokyo the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell 48.29 points or 0.3 percent to 14835.41. The U.S. dollar bought only 122.78 yen in late Tuesday trading in Tokyo 1.04 yen lower than Monday's rate. ASIAN MARKETS HONG KONG-ECONOMY    BRUSSELS Belgium AP  France's oil giant Total SA agreed to take over the Belgian petrochemicals company Petrofina SA to create the sixth-largest oil company in the world the companies announced Tuesday. The move was the latest in a series of mergers affecting the global oil market. The new company known as Total Fina will be quoted on the Paris Brussels New York and London stock exchanges a joint statement said. ``The combination of Total and Petrofina will allow the new entity to capture substantial productivity gains particularly in the North Sea and to expand its positions in the deep offshore United States Angola'' the statement said. BELGIUM-PETROFINA-TOTAL    BEIJING AP  China still plans to break up the country's telephone monopoly but foreign investors can't expect a slice of the fast-growing sector any time soon government officials said Tuesday. Even with the eventual end of China Telecom's monopoly senior officials with the Ministry of Information Industry said conditions were not ripe for foreign investors to operate in its highly protected telecommunications services sector. China Telecom towers over the huge market serving most of the 110 million telephone subscribers. That network is set to grow to 170 million in two years. Mobile phone users alone are expected to jump to 40 million from 23 million according to ministry figures. CHINA-PHONE MONOPOLY    FRANKFURT Germany AP  Even before Europe's single currency is launched politicians are challenging the independence of the central bank that will keep tabs on the new euro. Germany's new leaders have led the campaign demanding that the European Central Bank after it takes over monetary policy Jan. 1 lower interest rates to spur economic growth and create more jobs. The push reflects growing demands across the European Union for a more hands-on approach to monetary policy as the euro launch nears and some fear the tussle between politicians and bankers could damage the historic project. The contest  between the usual monetary goal of promoting low inflation and the broader political goal of spurring job creation  challenges the new central bank's guiding strategy: price stability modeled on the successful German Bundesbank. GERMANY-EURO PRESSURE    PARIS AP  Two of Europe's largest drug makers Hoechst of Germany and Rhone-Poulenc of France announced Tuesday they are merging their pharmaceutical and agrochemical operations. The new company will be called Aventis said a statement released by the two companies. It is to be based in Strasbourg eastern France. The agreement launches the first phase of a plan ``which will eventually lead to a full merger of Hoechst and Rhone Poulenc.'' Analysts have warned against a full merger until the heavily indebted firms reduce costs. With annual sales of around dlrs 20 billion the new company will be tied for the No. 1 ranking with Switzerland's Novartis in the life-sciences sector. RHONE POULENC-HOECHST

<HTML>    PHNOM PENH Cambodia AP  Prime Minister Hun Sen pushed Cambodia's case Tuesday for entry this month into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations saying the country had met all the conditions.    ``I strongly hope there won't be any reasons to leave Cambodia out of the regional framework because we have fulfilled everything we and our friends have required'' Hun Sen said at a ceremony introducing his trusted adviser Hor Nam Hong as the new foreign minister.    But Hun Sen spoke as Singapore's Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar currently the chairman of ASEAN's standing committee effectively ruled out Cambodia's chances of being admitted before a Dec. 15-16 summit in Hanoi.    Jayakumar said he had no plans to convene an urgent meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers and said the Hanoi meeting would focus on the economic slowdown affecting the region not Cambodia.    Parliament endorsed Hun Sen's new government Monday taking Cambodia a long way toward regaining international legitimacy lost when Hun Sen ousted his co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a coup last year.    Cambodia's seat in the United Nations has since been vacant and its entry  just weeks away at the time of the coup  into ASEAN suspended. ASEAN comprises Brunei Indonesia Laos Malaysia Myanmar the Philippines Singapore Thailand and Vietnam.    ASEAN was deeply involved in efforts to return a semblance of democracy to Cambodia and helped engineer the return of Ranariddh from abroad to lead his royalist party in new elections in July. Hun Sen's party narrowly won.    The opposition alleged fraud and violence and held up formation of a new government until Ranariddh citing international pressure agreed to a compromise earlier this month that made Hun Sen sole prime minister and the prince president of the National Assembly.    In a policy speech to parliament Monday Hun Sen promised the new government would carry out much-needed reforms that have been identified by foreign aid providers as crucial to Cambodia's development.    The prime minister reinforced his stance Tuesday saying that Cambodia's reentry into the international arena was the first step in putting the struggling country back on track.    ``Getting the ASEAN and U.N. seats along with normalization of relations with international monetary institutions like the IMF the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are the most urgent tasks'' Hun Sen said.    Several foreign governments are already hinting that Cambodia will see a return of aid that was sharply curtailed after Ranariddh's ouster.    Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Tuesday said that ``Japan will not spare any effort to ... support Cambodia's national reconstruction.''    Japan Cambodia's single largest donor was a key player in bringing Ranariddh back for the election.

<HTML>    PARAMARIBO Suriname AP  Delivering a major economic blow to Suriname's government two aluminum mining companies stopped paying taxes and exchanging their dollars through the national bank.    The Suriname Aluminum Co. a branch of Pittsburgh-based Aluminum Company of America and the Suriname Billiton Bauxite Co. claim the government cheated them out of dlrs 17 million over the last 14 months by buying their U.S. currency for half what it is worth.    They said Tuesday they would only convert enough money to meet their payroll of about 3000 people.    Suriname a Dutch-speaking country in South America exports bauxite and finished aluminum worth dlrs 359 million annually. The exports are the largest source of hard currency for the country  the Western Hemisphere's second-poorest after Haiti.    Under Surinamese law the two companies must change their foreign exchange earnings to Surinamese guilders through the Suriname Central Bank.    The service charge for the exchange is one of the largest sources of income for the government. Suriname Aluminum Co. alone exchanged about dlrs 2 million per month through the bank.    But the official exchange rate set by the bank is 396 guilders to the U.S. dollar while street prices hover around dlrs 700 to the dollar.    Natural resources minister Errol Alibux said he had called a meeting with leaders of the two companies to discuss the protest.    Suriname has been wracked by unrest linked to rising inflation despite efforts to control the exchange rate. A new sales tax imposed just before Christmas last year outraged workers. Government employees are currently in their fourth week of a strike to demand raises.

<HTML>    JOHANNESBURG South Africa AP  From bars in Hong Kong to the United Nations activists did what they could to turn the public's attention to the battle against AIDS which has reached epidemic proportions in developing countries.    Although powerful new medicines are helping industrialized countries fight the disease it will kill millions of people this year alone and is hitting hardest continents where people can't afford the drugs.    About 33.4 million people around the world are infected with HIV two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia and the Pacific 700000 people become infected with HIV per year.    In sub-Saharan Africa the 1998 death toll from AIDS is expected to be 2 million. Nearly 6 million more people will become infected this year  1.7 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa.    ``In the case of HIV/AIDS the difference in wealth becomes literally matter of life and death'' decried Mary Robinson the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.    Across the globe Tuesday activists preached safe sex. People pinned red ribbons on lapels to express solidarity in the fight against AIDS. In San Juan Puerto Rico more than 3000 people formed a human red ribbon to commemorate World AIDS Day.    ``It's important to be here to urge people to say `No' to AIDS and to protect themselves'' said Carlos Baerga a free agent baseball player most recently with the New York Mets. Those whose loved ones died from AIDS planned to toss carnations into the Atlantic Ocean in their memory.     In India where up to 5 million people are HIV positive hundreds of schoolchildren marched beside prostitutes in New Delhi to draw attention to the epidemic.    Israelis and Palestinians handed out condoms and literature to passengers departing Israel's international airport in Tel Aviv.     In Ivory Coast thousands of children wearing T-shirts with anti-AIDS slogans and bouncing inflated condoms like beach balls marched through the streets of Abidjan.     In Kenya children wearing black T-Shirts that said ``Stop AIDS'' distributed condoms and pamphlets on AIDS prevention in Dandora an eastern Nairobi slum.     In Hong Kong's nightspots activists handed out coasters with pictures of a condom on one side and a safe-sex message on the other.     In Tokyo Japan's Health Ministry held rallies and concerts in a central square.     In Moscow a contraceptive company's employees sheathed in red yellow or green ``condom suits'' handed out condoms in Pushkin Square.     In Pretoria South Africa clowns painted red AIDS ribbons on people's faces as drum majorettes entertained a crowd.    Underneath it all was a life-and-death message: Practice safe sex of face the consequences.    ``Come and witness the reality of AIDS. See the devastation in our community. See the fresh graves'' South African President Nelson Mandela told hundreds of people in a village in KwaZulu-Natal province where an estimated 25 percent of adults are infected with HIV.    But considering the enormity of the problem the call to action worldwide was muted.    In some countries like Zimbabwe where an estimated 23 percent of the population is infected with HIV World AIDS day passed with little fanfare. Countries in southern Africa have been slow to recognize the unfolding tragedy and have little resources to fight it.    It was only in October that the South African government launched an AIDS awareness program. Already more than 3 million South Africans are infected. This year an estimated 168000 have died from AIDS.    The vast majority of those infected in Africa and other developing regions cannot afford the drugs that are prolonging life among AIDS patients in the West.    In Washington President Bill Clinton announced dlrs 10 million in emergency grants to help children orphaned by AIDS in poorer nations. Much more assistance would be needed to help turn the tide.    Actress Sharon Stone speaking at the United Nations in New York urged parents to accept that they cannot control their children's urge to have sex  and to provide them with condoms so they don't join the 7000 young people who are infected every day with HIV.    Stone who campaigns for the American Foundation for AIDS Research spoke at a U.N. discussion on AIDS and youth.    ``If you truly truly love your children you need to supply condoms in a place in your home at a quantity that makes it a non-judgmental situation for them to have them'' she said.    And in New York a rally near City Hall was overshadowed by local politics focusing on complaints about tightfisted security that in recent months has all but cut off public access to the governmental building and its surrounding plaza.    Several hundred demonstrators shielded by a federal court order were greeted with steel barricades metal detectors and scores of police when they arrived at City Hall Tuesday to recognize the worldwide threat of AIDS and recall its victims.    Nobody was arrested and in the end police erected several barricaded pens in the parking lot one holding 150 demonstrators a second with people who addressed the crowd and a third to hold TV cameras and reporters.

<HTML>    Demonstrators chanted ``We want justice'' as the ambulance went past. Chilean diplomatic vehicles followed with armed police at the rear.    There was no immediate word on where Pinochet was headed. Supporters have been looking for a house where he can wait in comfort to learn whether the British government will agree to extradition.    There was speculation he would head to a nine-bedroom home on a luxurious estate in Surrey near the Wentworth Golf Club home of the European golf tour about 20 miles 30 kms west of central London.    If Home Secretary Jack Straw who must rule by Dec. 11 allows extradition proceedings to begin Pinochet will likely be in Britain for months fighting his case through the courts.    Wherever he stays his neighbors face disruption. Chilean exiles mount demonstrations and there is a police guard and heavy police presence.    Earlier his lawyer said Pinochet was distressed by the hospital's demand for him to leave. He had planned to move on Monday but the arrangement fell through because of ``unforeseen practical difficulties'' said lawyer Michael Caplan.    Adding to Pinochet's troubles an opinion poll published Tuesday indicated that a narrow majority  51 percent  of Britons think Pinochet should be extradited.    The National Opinion poll published in London's Evening Standard said 32 percent of a 961-strong sample of voters questioned nationwide wanted him sent home and the rest had no opinion. The error margin was plus or minus three percent.    A Chilean government report says some 3000 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's 1970-93 rule.    But Chile is trying to get him back because of fears that the anger of his supporters may destabilize its democracy.    Chile's foreign minister Jose Miguel Insulza was in Spain Tuesday after lobbying British officials arguing that Pinochet may be tried in Chile if he is freed.    mj

<HTML>    POTSDAM Germany AP  Germany and France agreed Tuesday that fighting unemployment should be Europe's top priority throwing their weight behind a shift toward a left-leaning agenda among European governments.    French and German leaders also called for tighter international scrutiny of the financial world including highly speculative ``hedge funds'' seen as a way to counter damaging swings in the markets.    In a joint declaration at the end of a two-day German-French summit in Potsdam outside of Berlin the leaders said a jobs creation pact is needed to offset years of government austerity measures to get Europe ready for the single currency the euro being launched Jan. 1.    ``We want to make a great common effort to move the theme of employment to the center of European politics'' German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told a news conference with French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.    Member governments of the European Union should set ``binding verifiable'' goals for putting their citizens back to work the leaders said in a declaration.    Unemployment in the 11 countries launching the euro is a stubborn 10.9 percent and putting people back to work has been a central political theme among European leaders.    The declaration emphasized the importance of the French-German relationship but there was discord too.    Both sides set officials to work to assess the possible effects of the new German government's pledge to wean the country off nuclear power. France has no such plans and does lucrative business reprocessing nuclear fuel from German power plants.    Chirac also refused comment on a recent call by German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer for NATO to abandon its doctrine allowing it to launch a nuclear attack with out being targeted first. The proposal has irritated the United States.    Both sides agreed to push plans to merge European aerospace industries to take on U.S. giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin though they didn't resolve the issue of French participation.    Schroeder told Chirac during the summit that he supports bringing together the British and German industries first if France doesn't join in from the start. He stressed though that the door would be left open to the French.    The big European aircraft makers  Daimler-Benz Aerospace British Aerospace and Aerospatiale  agreed in principle in March to seek a merger. Daimler-Benz Aerospace and British Aerospace are in advanced talks on a two-way alliance because of obstacles to Aerospatiale's early participation including slow progress toward privatization.    With the euro binding 11 European economies closer together than ever before the leaders also pledged to seek common European policies on taxes and workers' rights.    Germany and France hold summits twice yearly but this meeting has special significance because of the euro's debut and Germany's six-month EU presidency starting Jan. 1.    Schroeder sought French support for German demands to lower its contribution to the EU budget gaining Chirac's acknowledgement that ``there is a problem.''    Germany which contributes one-third of the EU budget annually pays 22 billion marks dlrs 12 billion more than it receives in funds.  UR; tc-cb

<HTML>    NYERI Kenya AP  Kenya and Ethiopia Tuesday pledged to monitor and maintain law and order along their common border where a recent attack on herders left at least 140 people dead.    The pledge was contained in a joint statement issued at the end of a three-day meeting in Kenya's Eastern Province on deteriorating security in the area.    Early last month armed men from southern Ethiopia attacked nomads at a watering hole in northeastern Kenya killing 140 people kidnapping another 52 and making off with 17500 cattle and camels.    Survivors  ethnic Somalis living in Kenya for generations  said many of the attackers were well-armed members of the Oromo tribe from southern Ethiopia.    The Oromo Liberation Front which seeks independence from Ethiopia for much of southern Ethiopia crosses back and forth into Kenya.    The joint statement said a regular exchange of information about activities along the border was necessary to increase security.    Northeastern Province Commissioner Maurice Makhanu who headed the Kenyan delegation called for an all-out effort to enhance peace and security in the area.    The 18-man Ethiopian delegation was headed by Federal Police Commissioner Maj. Alemseged G. Yohannes.    The talks centered on border security and cooperation between the two countries including illegal movement of people trafficking of arms across the border revival of radio communication between the two security sides and cooperation on anti-terrorism. Other areas covered were immigration refugee matters and border inspection and maintenance.    The delegates suggested that meetings be held twice a year and fixed the next for April in Bahr-Dar Ethiopia.    jb/sl

<HTML>    TEHRAN Iran AP  Iran will test an electronic warfare system capable of jamming enemy radar in maneuvers scheduled for later this week a military official said Tuesday.    He said that until now the Iranian navy only had the capability to defend against electronic warfare. But new systems developed internally will give Iranian warships the capability of jamming enemy electronics the official said. He spoke on customary condition of anonymity.    The five-day maneuvers code-named Unity 77 will be launched later this week perhaps as early as Thursday with some 50000 troops participating.    The navy commander Rear Adm. Ali Akbar Ahmadian said Monday that Oman will send observers to the war games.    He said the maneuvers will take place in an area extending from the central Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf of Oman.    Iran has tried for a decade to conduct joint military exercises with Gulf states which are allies of the United States. But so far no Gulf country has agreed to take part because of Tehran's insistence that U.S. warships should leave the region.    The war games will involve missile-launching units of the Revolutionary Guards and mock ``electronic warfare will be carried out over a wide area'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.    Among the maneuvers' goals will be to assess Iran's defense against chemical biological and nuclear attacks IRNA said.    Iran concluded military exercises involving some 200000 troops on its border with Afghanistan last month after Afghanistan's Taliban militia killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.

<HTML>    ZURICH Switzerland AP  Swiss stores have withdrawn about 10000 bottles of Barolo and Burgundy wines after they were found to contain glycerin Swiss television reported Tuesday.    Glycerin is used to improve the taste of poor quality produce. Although it poses no health risk it is banned to protect consumers from being misled.    The Kassensturz Cash Check consumer program said it sent samples of the quality wines mostly costing more than 30 Swiss francs dlrs 21 per bottle to a government laboratory for testing.    Two out of five samples of French Burgundy wine and seven of 21 Barolo wines from northern Italy contained illegally added glycerin it said. One of the samples was ``Paolo Scavino'' regarded as one of Italy's best wines.    Kassensturz said that wine dealers and the Coop supermarket chain had withdrawn 10000 bottles of the wine in question.  UR; cn

<HTML>    BANGKOK Thailand AP  For a few hours Sunday Thais will be able to cast aside worries about the lingering Asian economic crisis and revel in a spectacular cultural celebration marking the opening of the 13th Asian Games.    Several thousand people got a sneak preview of the festivities Tuesday when the final rehearsal for the ceremony was thrown open to the public at the last minute.    The rehearsal was originally supposed to be open then last week was turned into a closed activity for what organizers said were security reasons.    ``Besides we don't want to give away the climax of the event'' Somjainuk Engtrakul chairman of the ticketing committee told reporters about an hour before Tuesday's rehearsal began.    But stadium guards somehow slipped up and about 1500 ordinary citizens were admitted to the crowd that was originally supposed to be limited to members of the press foreign dignitaries government officials and the games' organizers.    With the gates breached the decision was made to admit all comers and many of the stadium's 60000 seats quickly filled up.    The lucky spectators watched 7614 performers take part in a nearly four-hour show of lavishly-produced acts with the theme ``Friendship Beyond Frontiers.''    The combined budget for the opening and closing ceremonies is 70 million baht dlrs 1.94 million and that includes a large share of donated and at-cost labor.    For an overture songs written by the country's multi-talented King Bhumibol Adulyadej the world's longest-reigning monarch were played by the Western-style Bangkok Symphony Orchestra along with the Fong Nam band a kind of new wave traditional Thai ensemble.    The emphasis shifted to the visual for the next act as hundreds of performers in ancient Thai garb marched down the center of the field to a majestic tune followed by people-drawn chariots.    Hundreds of primary school students dressed in colorful outfits for the next two performances celebrating both the unity of Asia and Chai-yo the cartoon elephant mascot of the games. Elephants have long been a symbol of Thailand.    The athletes' march then followed  with performers as stand-ins  with representatives of the 41 countries taking place in what organizers bill as the last major sporting event of the 20th century.    At the actual event on Sunday King Bhumibol will officially proclaim the games open.    Issaraporn Suktha a gold medal weightlifter for Thailand at the last Southeast Asian Games will then carry the torch into the stadium and Somluck Khamsing a boxer who won Thailand's first-ever Olympic gold medal in 1996 in Atlanta will take it the last lap to light the flame.    The artistic high point came next as the warlike beat of drums announced the Gathering of Heavenly Spirits a show based on the Indian Ramayana epic the basis for much of traditional Thai mythology literature and performing and fine arts.    The field became a swirl of giant snakes swans birds angels and other mystical creatures all cheered by the crowd.    Another performance celebrating the unity of Asia capped the show with four large swan floats pulled to the middle of the field to each tethered a giant balloon symbolizing the sun moon earth and a giant lotus.    ``The lighting was 80 percent OK while the sound was 90 percent'' said Thisana Duandao a producer with JSL the private company putting on the show. ``Overall we are satisfied with the performance. We have minor adjustments to make.''    Bhichai Rattakul deputy prime minister and chairman of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee who has been losing sleep over whether organizational problems can be overcome at the last minute pronounced himself ``very happy.''

<HTML>    BEIJING AP  China is bracing for a fourfold rise in AIDS cases within two years and putting in place a 12-year plan to try to slow the rapid increase.    Issued on the eve of Tuesday's World AIDS Day China's AIDS control program hopes to keep the number of people suffering from the HIV virus that causes the disease to under 1.5 million by 2010 the official Xinhua News Agency reported late Monday.    Although China has officially recorded 11170 HIV cases Health Ministry officials estimate that more than 300000 Chinese have the disease. Xinhua said that number is expected to swell to 1.2 million by 2000.    To mark World AIDS Day and show greater government commitment to controlling the disease Beijing on Tuesday opened its first exhibition on the disease featuring photos of drug users and AIDS patients.    For the first half of the 1990s China's AIDS epidemic was confined largely to counties along the southwestern border with Southeast Asia's heroin producing region known as the Golden Triangle. But flourishing drug and sex trades have carried the disease into every part of China.    Citing unnamed government and AIDS experts Xinhua said that sharing of contaminated needles among drug users accounted for the majority of HIV cases. In a worrying sign for the future the number of sexually transmitted diseases is increasing 16 percent annually.    Under the Health Ministry's action plan China hopes to lower the growth rate of sexually transmitted diseases to 15 percent by 2002 and will launch a nationwide campaign to educate people how to prevent AIDS Xinhua said.    The AIDS control plan also vowed to:     educate 80 percent of prostitutes drug users and other high-risk groups; and 70 percent of city and 40 percent of rural residents;     put education programs in all higher education secondary and vocational schools drug rehabilitation centers jails and labor camps.    In addition by 2005 the Health Ministry will set up a network of 30 provincial laboratories and one national reference center to monitor AIDS trends. Hospitals in major cities and areas with high numbers of AIDS cases are supposed to set up treatment centers and counseling services and purge their blood supplies of the disease.

<HTML>    PHOENIX AP  Olympic champion Gary Hall was cleared Tuesday to swim in a World Cup meet despite a marijuana-related suspension scheduled to run through Dec. 12.    U.S. federal court Judge Roger Strand who issued a temporary restraining order Monday allowing Hall to compete upheld by his earlier ruling.    FINA swimming's world governing body contended Hall's appeal should be dismissed and the rest of his suspension upheld. The organization said the court should have no jurisdiction in the case.    FINA secretary Gunnar Werner said the federation would not appeal.    ``We can do nothing more other than obey the order'' he said Tuesday by phone from Sweden.    ``This decision is only valid in the United States'' he added. ``Hall is still suspended in the rest of the world.''    Hall's appeal against FINA's three-month suspension still has to be heard in full by the Court of Arbitration of Sport in Switzerland.    ``Our position is that FINA rules are prevailing in a case like this'' Werner said. ``Our position is the court in the U.S. is not competent.''    Werner said an appeal would take too long. He added that the case underscores the ongoing battle between international sports federations and the courts especially in the United States.    ``Our position is that FINA rules should prevail all around the world'' he said. ``But what can we do if a national court makes a ruling? We can only fight for our position.''    Hall who lives in Phoenix won gold medals as part of the U.S. 400-meter freestyle and 400 medley relay teams in the 1996 Atlanta Games. He also won silver medals in the 50 and 100 freestyle.    He was scheduled to compete in Tuesday's World Cup meet and later this week in the U.S. Open meet both in College Station Texas.    His lawyers argued that both competitions are essential to Hall's bid to compete in the 2000 Olympics and secure endorsements.    Hall was temporarily suspended in July after FINA said he tested positive for marijuana during a May 15 competition in Phoenix. That prevented Hall from swimming in the Goodwill Games and the U.S. Senior Nationals.    The federation delayed the suspension in August to allow a hearing after Hall appealed.    During a Nov. 6 hearing Hall received his three-month suspension from FINA's doping panel for testing positive for marijuana. That suspension was effective Nov. 12.    FINA then deducted two of the three months already served by Hall during the temporary suspension which left him with 30 more days to serve.

The new center is located in the same building as Budapest City Hall.    ``I'm proud that from now on the flag of the European Union will be flying high on the City Hall'' said Budapest Mayor Gabor Demszky.    Similar information centers operate in the capitals of EU countries and one was opened in Prague six weeks ago Lake said.    Hungary was among the first European countries along with the Czech Republic and Poland to be invited to join NATO. Hungary along with the Czech Republic are also among the first nations under consideration for the first round of EU enlargement.    The center offers services to people interested in EU-related topics such as regulations policies and legislation from agriculture to security and foreign policy through EU databases via the Internet CD-ROMs video tapes as well as read books and brochures.    ek/amb/me

<HTML>    BORDEAUX France AP  American fugitive Ira Einhorn appeared in court Tuesday for a hearing to determine whether he'll be extradited to the United States for the brutal 1977 murder of his girlfriend. The court said it would rule on Jan. 12.    Einhorn 57 has been sentenced in absentia to life in prison by a Pennsylvania court for the murder of Helen ``Holly'' Maddux  a crime he denies even though police found her corpse stuffed in a trunk in his closet.    A prominent anti-war campaigner and New Age activist in the 1960s Einhorn fled the United States shortly before he was due to be tried. But after 16 years in hiding he was tracked down and arrested at his French home in June 1997.    Einhorn entered the court building Tuesday holding hands with his companion Anika Flodin and refused to answer questions.    But the victim's sister Elisabeth Hall accompanied by other family members was more outspoken.    ``We are here in France to remind the judges that underneath all this international law and political squabbling there is a person who was murdered and who looks like us'' Hall said.    ``Anybody can see there has been a definite undercurrent of anti-Americanism'' she said.    After a French court refused to extradite Einhorn in December 1997 citing a French law that would have required a retrial if he was extradited Pennsylvania passed a law promising Einhorn a retrial. He was re-arrested in September.    His defense lawyers argue that if extradited Einhorn could face the death penalty which is banned under French law. They also claim Pennsylvania courts might withdraw the pledge of a retrial.    In a November interview on ABC television Einhorn proclaimed his innocence and claimed the CIA or KGB framed him after he uncovered classified mind-control experiments.    When Maddux a former cheerleader from Tyler Texas disappeared Einhorn said she had gone shopping and never returned.    But when neighbors 18 months later told police of a stench coming from Einhorn's apartment her battered remains were found. Forensic experts said her skull had been smashed six times.    ip-jn-parf

<HTML>    TOKYO AP  Spanish striker Raul Gonzalez scored with eight minutes remaining and gave Real Madrid a 2-1 victory over Brazil's Vasco da Gama on Tuesday night for its first Toyota Cup title since 1960.    Gonzalez settled Clarence Seedorf's pass before scoring giving Real the crown for the first time since it won the inaugural trophy 38 years ago.    It was the fourth straight victory and 17th overall for Europe in the annual battle against South America for what is considered the world club championship.

It took 19 minutes before Vasco could equalize when Juninho scored after Real Madrid goalkeeper Bodo Illgner fumbled the a shot by Ramon.    Vasco making its first appearance in the Toyota Cup in centennial year threatened repeatedly but were thwarted by Illgner.    Raul broke the deadlock but controlling a long pass from Seedorf in the penalty area eluding two defenders in front of the net and beating Vasco keeper Germany.    ``We had a several chances in the second half but we couldn't make it while the other Real Madrid made a few chance for the goal'' Vasco manager Antonio Lopez said.    Gonzalez who scored a dramatic goal on a left-footed volley in a 3-2 World Cup loss to Nigeria in Spain's opener at France was named the game's most valuable player for Tuesday's effot receive an Altezza car from title sponsor Toyota.    ``Everybody wants to score a goal in a final'' said the 21-year-old Raul now in his fourth season with Real. ``Today we played more like a team and that's why we won.''

<HTML>    TOKYO AP  Spanish striker Raul Gonzalez scored with eight minutes remaining and gave Real Madrid a 2-1 victory over Brazil's Vasco da Gama on Tuesday night for its first Toyota Cup title since 1960.    Gonzalez settled Clarence Seedorf's pass before scoring giving Real the crown for the first time since it won the inaugural trophy 38 years ago.    It was the fourth straight victory and 17th overall for Europe in the annual battle against South America for what is considered the world club championship. South America's Copa Libertadores champions still hold the edge having won 20 of the 37 titles.    ``We are very pleased to win the title'' Real manager Guus Hiddink said. ``We thought we could play well in general.''    Playing before more than 51000 spectators at Tokyo's National Stadium Vasco da Gama's Nasa gave Real Madrid the lead in the 25th minute trying to head away Roberto Carlos' cross at the penalty spot but instead putting it in his own net.    It took 19 minutes before Vasco could equalize when Juninho scored after Real Madrid goalkeeper Bodo Illgner fumbled the a shot by Ramon.    Vasco making its first appearance in the Toyota Cup in centennial year threatened repeatedly but were thwarted by Illgner.    Raul broke the deadlock but controlling a long pass from Seedorf in the penalty area eluding two defenders in front of the net and beating Vasco keeper Germany.    ``We had a several chances in the second half but we couldn't make it while the other Real Madrid made a few chance for the goal'' Vasco manager Antonio Lopez said.    Gonzalez who scored a dramatic goal on a left-footed volley in a 3-2 World Cup loss to Nigeria in Spain's opener at France was named the game's most valuable player for Tuesday's effot receive an Altezza car from title sponsor Toyota.    ``Everybody wants to score a goal in a final'' said the 21-year-old Raul now in his fourth season with Real. ``Today we played more like a team and that's why we won.''

<HTML>    POTSDAM Germany AP  Germany and France proposed broad new priorities for Europe on Tuesday reflecting the left's influence on the political mood: a governmental push to create jobs and better regulation of financial markets.    Leading his first summit since taking office German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's center-left politics breathed new life into French-German relations. The ties strong when both nations were run by conservatives had stagnated after France's government turned left under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.    Schroeder spoke of ``a new dynamic'' between Europe's two closest partners and biggest nations now back in synch under left-leaning governments since his election in September. Just as Chancellor Helmut Kohl emphasized his personal friendship with Francois Mitterrand Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac displayed an obvious liking for each other.    The German and French leaders agreed Tuesday to make a new push to give the European Union military capability of its own parallel to NATO a project dear to the French and recently supported by Britain.    But jobs were the focus of the summit as the two nations renewed their role as the engine behind efforts to turn Europe into an economic superpower. Unemployment in the 11 countries launching Europe's single currency the euro on Jan. 1 is a stubborn 10.9 percent and putting people back to work has been a dominant political theme among European leaders.    ``We want to make a great common effort to move the theme of employment to the center of European politics'' Schroeder a center-left Social Democrat told a news conference with Chirac and Jospin.    In a joint declaration the leaders said a jobs creation pact is needed to offset government austerity pledges designed to bolster the euro. European governments should set binding targets for putting their citizens back to work the declaration said.    With the euro tying 11 European economies closer together than ever before the leaders also pledged to make workers' rights a greater focus in the European Union.    Taking their cue from a campaign by Germany's leftist finance minister Oskar Lafontaine they called for tighter financial regulation internationally to counter economically damaging swings in the markets.    The proposals were a departure from the Kohl era when Germany resisted calls for a common European fight against joblessness.    Despite the warmth among the leaders and the common vision for guiding Europe toward the single currency and EU expansion there also was discord at the summit.    Both governments said they would study the impact of Germany's pledge to abolish nuclear power. France which has no such plans does lucrative business reprocessing nuclear fuel from German power plants.    Both sides agreed to push plans to merge European aerospace industries to take on U.S. giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin though they didn't resolve the issue of whether the French would immediately participate. Schroeder said he supports German and British aerospace firms in their efforts to merge even if the French only join later.  UR; tc-cb

<HTML>    LONDON AP  A gay rights activist was convicted Tuesday of ``indecent behavior in a church'' under a seldom-invoked law and fined 18.60 pounds dlrs 30.69 in a token punishment alluding to the year the law was created.    Peter Tatchell who heads the British gay rights group Outrage was arrested under the 1860 Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act after he staged a three-minute protest beneath the pulpit as the Archbishop of Canterbury Britain's top cleric was about to deliver his Easter Sunday sermon April 12 at Canterbury Cathedral.    In front of a congregation of about 1000 people  while six of his fellow protesters held up placards under the pulpit he had criticized the archbishop's opposition to lowering the homosexual age of consent and the church's ban on the ordination of gay clergy.    His case sparked a high-profile campaign to get the law repealed when free speech activists feared he would face a two month jail sentence  the maximum penalty and the sentence handed down when the law was last used in 1966 when anti-war protesters interrupted a church service.    But Canterbury Stipendiary Magistrate Michael Kelly instead sentenced Tatchell to the fine saying he considered the offense equivalent to a minor public disorder infraction.    During the two-day trial Tatchell had argued that his right to free speech was guaranteed under human rights laws. But the magistrate said the same human rights law also provided for the rights of people to worship.    ``You are a man of previous good character and you have a clear commitment to your cause and a belief in non-violent protest'' Kelly said.    But he admonished Tatchell nonetheless.    ``I am sure that some people will have been disgusted and truly offended by your conduct'' he said. ``I agree with your counsel when he said that the Church of England is a robust institution and I have no doubt that in spite of the publicity here your puerile conduct will soon be forgotten although your cause may not be.''    ``I think your conduct violated the rights of worshippers on one of the most important days in the Christian calendar'' he said.    Tatchell said after the trial that he had no regrets ``about standing up for democracy.''    er

<HTML>    MONTREAL AP  With two struggling teams facing each other the winner needed a little luck.    Montreal center Saku Koivu was credited with the game's opening goal at the 6:17 mark of the second period. But it was Los Angeles defenseman Sean O'Donnell who actually steered Koivu's rebound into his own net.    That started the Canadiens to a 3-1 victory Monday night as Montreal snapped a three-game losing streak.    ``They needed a break  they're struggling  and they got it'' O'Donnell said. ``It just continues for us.''    It was the only NHL game played Monday.    Los Angeles 6-14-3 has only managed to accumulate five points two wins and a tie in its last 14 games and has lost eight of its last nine.    Despite sliding face down toward the net Koivu managed to direct a shot towards the Kings' goal that seemed to catch Los Angeles goalie Stephane Fiset by surprise. Fiset made a toe save but O'Donnell's stick directed the puck into the open side to Fiset's left.    ``I made the save and Sean O'Donnell tried just to put the puck in the corner but it hit his stick and went right in'' Fiset said. ``It's getting frustrating for us because we aren't getting any of the bounces.''

<HTML>    RIBEIRAO PIRES Brazil AP  Rosalvo Amaral's job prospects usually died when he showed his identity card. In place of his signature was a word he couldn't understand: illiterate.    Francois Courtes a French-born industrialist needed skilled workers to improve quality at his strongbox factory in this Sao Paulo suburb. He was alarmed to learn nine of his 46 employees couldn't read or write.    Their common need brought them together. Today Amaral is among 20 adults studying their alphabet at a course in Courtes' factory.    As Brazil painfully emerges from decades of market protections to compete in the global economy illiteracy remains a major obstacle. Two-thirds of the work force  nearly 50 million Brazilians  dropped out before finishing high school.    The Sao Paulo Trade Federation says Brazilian workers spend on average less than four years in school compared to 11 years in South Korea nearly nine in Argentina and 7 1/2 in Chile. Poor education often means poorer quality for Brazilian goods and a smaller chance for companies to compete in world markets.    As those markets shrink in a global economic crisis Brazilians are learning that only the best will survive. And an unlikely alliance of unions and big business has emerged to try to improve labor and product.    In Ribeirao Pires and other industrial suburbs ringing Sao Paulo South America's biggest city hundreds of adults are enrolled in literacy classes offered by factories and private businesses.    The project was proposed by the powerful Union of Metal Workers  and signaled an about-face in the confrontational tactics long used by labor.    Union leader Luiz Marinho knows both approaches. Twenty years ago at age 15 he fought at street barricades in labor protests. Today he sits down with business executives politicians and bankers discussing ways to improve the quality of life.    ``We now look at the entire society'' Marinho said. ``We look for comprehensive solutions to the most pressing problems from reinforcing river banks to building clinics.''    One result of cooperation is a dramatic decrease in strikes. Last year there were just four strikes in Sao Paulo's industrial belt compared to 850 in 1978.    Better education also is an essential part of the cooperative atmosphere.    ``We have to make the region attractive to private investments'' Marinho said. ``They will choose places with good road networks with good public utilities where levels of education are high.''    For unions the bottom line is jobs.    Unemployment has soared since 1994 as Brazil wrestled inflation down from 50 percent a month to under 4 percent a year. Officially the jobless rate is 8.2 percent the worst in 15 years. But unions say the rate is really around 20 percent.    Everyone agrees it will get worse. After local financial markets tumbled and foreign investors pulled back from Brazil in August the government ratcheted interest rates up to nearly 50 percent and promised to cut spending. For Latin America's biggest economy the prognosis is stagnant growth or recession.    The auto industry a big employer has felt the pinch. After production last year hit a record 2 million vehicles sales have slumped. In September the local plants of Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. announced they will idle thousands of workers.    For industry the goal of the literacy classes is to raise quality and competitiveness.    Courtes the factory owner saw his plans to obtain a quality certificate for his plant stymied by uneducated employees. ``Some workers couldn't read the instructions or fill out forms'' he said.    He has high hopes for the literacy campaign which gives students the equivalent of a fourth-grade education. A    ``People feel better and happier'' Courtes said. ``This helps a lot in the production process.''    Evandro Salero manager at the Irmaos Correia bus company also noticed a dramatic change in his workers after he started a literacy program.    ``In just weeks they were more confident and spoke up their minds articulately'' he said. ``Look at them now. They want to continue; they want to go further.''    Amaral the student at Courtes' plant is hoping to get a leg up in the job competition.    ``Maybe I'll be ready to learn a profession'' he said. ``At least things may change and I will find a stable job again.''    But already his world is changing.    ``I didn't know how good it feels to see those letters and discover they form meanings'' he said.

<HTML>    HAVANA AP  Christmas in Cuba is back for good.    The Communist Party used the entire front page of Cuba's only daily newspaper Granma on Tuesday to recommend that ``from this year on'' Dec. 25 should be a holiday in Cuba formally re-establishing a custom abolished in 1969.    The proposal is sure to be adopted by the Communist country's government.    The Roman Catholic archbishop's office had no immediate reaction to the recommendation.    The government granted a Christmas holiday last year as a one-time favor to Pope John Paul II who visited in January. But at the time it balked at declaring the measure permanent.    Cuba abolished the Christmas holiday in 1969 saying it interfered with the mobilization of manpower for the sugar harvest.    The party declaration insisted that the abolition of the holiday was not inspired by any anti-religious sentiment.    However the government at the time was avowedly atheist and Christians were barred from being members of the Communist Party or of holding many sensitive jobs.    Christmas trees were strongly discouraged.    In recent years the government has declared itself secular rather than atheist has dropped restrictions on Christians and moved to improve ties with Cuba's churches and other religions.    Even state stores are selling plastic Christmas trees and ornaments this year.    In its statement the party praised churches for condemning the U.S. embargo of Cuba for sending aid and for speaking out in favor of social justice around the world.

<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  The Russian government on Tuesday dismissed allegations that its secret services provoked a recent confrontation between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan two ex-Soviet republics in Central Asia.    ``Any claims about the Russian secret services involvement in the exacerbation of the Uzbek-Tajik relations are absolutely groundless'' the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.    Uzbek President Islam Karimov on Monday accused the Russian Federal Security Service FSB the main successor of the KGB of provoking a recent dispute between his nation and neighboring Tajikistan.    The dispute centered on an anti-government rebellion last month in Tajikistan which was put down after several days of fierce fighting that claimed 334 lives.    Tajik authorities accused Uzbekistan of helping train the rebels commanded by former Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev and harboring them after their defeat. Uzbekistan has angrily denied the claims.    Karimov claimed an FSB officer an ethnic Tajik fomented the uprising. The FSB acknowledged the officer Rizo Tursunov is an agent but said he had no role in the incident.    Tajikistan an impoverished nation reeling from several years of civil war has been plagued by frequent clashes despite a peace deal signed last year by the Russian-backed hardline government and the mostly Islamic opposition.    ``Our efforts are aimed at consistent support of national reconciliation and ensuring peace process in Tajikistan'' the Russian foreign ministry said. ``Russia isn't pursuing any other interests in the region.''    vi/ren

<HTML>    BRUSSELS Belgium AP  With just a month to go before the launch of the euro European Union finance ministers reached an 11th-hour agreement Tuesday on who should speak for the single-currency bloc on the world stage.    The agreement resolved months of deadlock between big and small nations over who should represent the 11-nation currency bloc at the G-7 group of world economic powers and other international meetings.    Under the compromise three existing G-7 nations  Germany France and Italy  keep their seats and will take turns to represent the bloc. Details of the deal were sketchy but it appeared that smaller nations would also get a chance to set at G-7 meetings when they holds the six-month euro-zone presidency.    That means German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine will speak for the euro-zone for the first six months of 1999 to be joined by his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niniisto for second half of the year.    The European Central Bank which will oversee monetary policy in the euro-zone will replace national central banks at G-7 meetings. The EU's executive Commission will offer only ``technical assistance'' to the European delegation.    The launch of the euro as the shared currency of 11 EU nations will create a single bloc that could rival the United States and Japan as a global economic power.    But while U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa can always get on the phone to discuss the world's economic situation nobody was sure whom to call when they wanted to speak to the euro-bloc.    The rotating system of euro-zone presidencies should go some way to meeting that need. The deal is set to be confirmed by EU leaders at their year-end summit next week in Vienna Austria.    The issue had provoked a rift between the EU's existing G-7 members who refused to relinquish their seats and smaller euro-zone nations who demanded some sort of representation. There was no immediate reaction to the deal from other G-7 nations  the United States Japan and Canada. Britain the EU's fourth G-7 members is staying out of the euro.    Later Tuesday the ministers were set to review plans to close tax loopholes that cost national treasuries billions of dollars in lost revenue. Officials played down talk of a rift between Britain and Germany over tax plans.    British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown criticized recent ``scare stories'' in the London press about alleged German plans to impose EU-wide taxes. However he repeated British opposition to any such plans.    ``Some people want to argue that there is an inevitability about a single currency leading to a single tax rate'' Brown told the British Braodcasting Corp. ``That is not the way that I see it.''

<HTML>    JOHANNESBURG South Africa AP  Activists across the globe marched in the streets distributed condoms and held benefit concerts Tuesday to try to halt the spread of AIDS which will kill millions of people this year alone.    Underscoring events on World AIDS Day was this sobering fact: Although powerful new medicines are helping industrialized countries win the battle against the disease it has reached epidemic proportions in continents where people can't afford the drugs.    About 33.4 million people around the world are infected with HIV two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia and the Pacific 700000 people become infected with HIV per year.    In sub-Saharan Africa the 1998 death toll from AIDS is expected to be 2 million. Nearly 6 million more people will become infected this year  1.7 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa.    ``In the case of HIV/AIDS the difference in wealth becomes literally matter of life and death'' decried Mary Robinson the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.    From bars in Hong Kong to parks in South Africa activists preached safe sex. People pinned red ribbons on lapels to express solidarity in the fight against AIDS.     In India where up to 5 million people are HIV positive hundreds of schoolchildren marched beside prostitutes in New Delhi to draw attention to the epidemic.    Israelis and Palestinians handed out condoms and literature to passengers departing Israel's international airport in Tel Aviv.     In Ivory Coast thousands of children wearing T-shirts with anti-AIDS slogans and bouncing inflated condoms like beach balls marched through the streets of Abidjan.     In Kenya children wearing black T-Shirts that said ``Stop AIDS'' distributed condoms and pamphlets on AIDS prevention in Dandora an eastern Nairobi slum.     In Hong Kong's nightspots activists handed out coasters with pictures of a condom on one side and a safe-sex message on the other.     In Tokyo Japan's Health Ministry held rallies and concerts in a central square.     In Moscow a contraceptive company's employees sheathed in red yellow or green ``condom suits'' handed out condoms in Pushkin Square.     In Pretoria South Africa clowns painted red AIDS ribbons on people's faces as drum majorettes entertained a crowd.    Underneath it all was a life-and-death message: Practice safe sex of face the consequences.    ``Come and witness the reality of AIDS. See the devastation in our community. See the fresh graves'' South African President Nelson Mandela told hundreds of people in a village in KwaZulu-Natal province where an estimated 25 percent of adults are infected with HIV.    But considering the enormity of the problem the call to action worldwide was muted.    In some countries like Zimbabwe where an estimated 23 percent of the population is infected with HIV World AIDS day passed with little fanfare. Countries in southern Africa have been slow to recognize the unfolding tragedy and have little resources to fight it.    It was only in October that the South African government launched an AIDS awareness program. Already more than 3 million South Africans are infected. This year an estimated 168000 have died from AIDS.    The vast majority of those infected in Africa and other developing regions cannot afford the drugs that are prolonging life among AIDS patients in the West.    In Washington President Bill Clinton announced dlrs 10 million in emergency grants to help children orphaned by AIDS in poorer nations. Much more assistance would be needed to help turn the tide.    Robinson the top human rights official at the U.N. said: ``The current situation is an indictment of the international allocation of resources to fight HIV/AIDS in developing nations.

<HTML>    BORDEAUX France AP  American fugitive Ira Einhorn appeared in court Tuesday for a hearing to determine whether he'll be extradited to the United States for the brutal 1977 murder of his girlfriend. The court said it would rule on Jan. 12.    The 57-year-old fugitive was defiant as he again denied killing Helen ``Holly'' Maddux whose corpse was found in a trunk in his closet.    ``One thing'' Einhorn said pointing his finger at the judge. ``I did not kill Holly Maddux. C'est tout That's all.''    That was Einhorn's only statement and it left Maddux's siblings shaking their heads in disbelief.    ``It was a clear attempt to provoke some outburst from us'' said Elisabeth Hall the victim's sister. ``He's a pitiful character and knows exactly what he has done.''    Einhorn has been sentenced in absentia to life in prison by a Pennsylvania court for the murder.    A prominent anti-war campaigner and New Age activist in the 1960s Einhorn fled the United States shortly before he was due to be tried. But after 16 years in hiding he was tracked down and arrested at his French home in June 1997.    Einhorn looked relaxed during the two-hour hearing only occasionally glancing at the three sisters and brother of his alleged victim.    He entered the court building Tuesday holding hands with his companion Anika Flodin and refused to answer questions.    But the Ms. Hall was more outspoken.    ``We are here in France to remind the judges that underneath all this international law and political squabbling there is a person who was murdered and who looks like us'' Hall said.    ``Anybody can see there has been a definite undercurrent of anti-Americanism'' she said.    A French court refused to extradite Einhorn in December 1997 citing a French law that would have required a retrial if he was extradited. Pennsylvania then passed a law promising Einhorn a retrial. He was re-arrested in September.    His defense lawyers argue that if extradited Einhorn could face the death penalty which is banned under French law. They also claim Pennsylvania courts might withdraw the pledge of a retrial.    In a November interview on ABC television Einhorn declared his innocence and claimed the CIA or KGB framed him after he uncovered classified mind-control experiments.    When Maddux a former cheerleader from Tyler Texas disappeared Einhorn said she had gone shopping and never returned.    But 18 months later neighbors told police of a stench coming from Einhorn's apartment and Maddux's battered remains were found. Forensic experts said her skull had been smashed six times.    ip-jn-parf

<HTML>    LONDON AP  Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet left a north London psychiatric hospital Tuesday evening driven away to an undisclosed destination in an ambulance in a covoy headed by police vehicles.    To chants of ``We want justice'' from demonstrators some shaking their fists the ambulance swept through the gates of Grovelands Priory a day after the hospital announced that the 83-year-old general did not need medical care and demanded that he leave.    The move by the hospital where Pinochet has been since Oct. 29 dealt a blow to any plan he had to plead he is too ill to be extradited to Spain to stand trial on charges of genocide and torture.    Chilean diplomatic cars followed the ambulance into the night with armed police in a vehicle at the rear.    There was no immediate word on where Pinochet was headed. Supporters have been looking for a house where he can wait in comfort to learn whether the British government will agree to extradition.    There was speculation he would head to a nine-bedroom home on a luxurious estate in Surrey near the Wentworth Golf Club home of the European golf tour about 20 miles 30 kms west of central London.    If Home Secretary Jack Straw who must rule by Dec. 11 allows extradition proceedings to begin Pinochet will likely be in Britain for months fighting his case through the courts.    Wherever he stays his neighbors face disruption. Chilean exiles mount demonstrations and there is a police guard and heavy police presence.    Earlier his lawyer said Pinochet was distressed by the hospital's demand for him to leave. He had planned to move on Monday but the arrangement fell through because of ``unforeseen practical difficulties'' said lawyer Michael Caplan.    Adding to Pinochet's troubles an opinion poll published Tuesday indicated that a narrow majority  51 percent  of Britons think Pinochet should be extradited.    The National Opinion poll published in London's Evening Standard said 32 percent of a 961-strong sample of voters questioned nationwide wanted him sent home and the rest had no opinion. The error margin was plus or minus three percent.    A Chilean government report says some 3000 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's 1970-93 rule.    But Chile is trying to get him back because of fears that the anger of his supporters may destabilize its democracy.    Chile's foreign minister Jose Miguel Insulza was in Spain Tuesday after lobbying British officials arguing that Pinochet may be tried in Chile if he is freed.    mj

<HTML>    JERUSALEM AP  A senior Palestinian official on Tuesday appealed to U.S. President Bill Clinton to resolve growing tensions over Israel's refusal to release jailed anti-Israel activists.    Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he could not release prisoners who had been involved in attacks on Israelis. ``I will not back down on this'' he vowed.    The issue which has prompted clashes between stone-throwing Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers is raising concern about an outbreak of violence before Clinton's Dec. 12-15 visit to Israel and the Palestinian-ruled lands.    The Israeli daily Haaretz reported that Israeli security officials had urged Netanyahu to agree to free more Palestinian activists to prevent rioting.    Palestinians claim that Israel promised at last month's Wye River summit to free 750 prisoners from political factions such as Yasser Arafat's Fatah group. Israel released 250 prisoners last month but most were car thieves and petty crooks.    ``This deception is creating demonstrations anger and frustration in the Palestinian community'' Ahmed Tibi an adviser to Arafat said at a Foreign Press Association news conference.    Demonstrations have been held almost daily in support of Palestinian prisoners with some of the anger turned on Yasser Arafat and his government.    On Tuesday protests were held in the West Bank town of Ramallah where several hundred demonstrators gathered and in the Gaza Strip where about 150 children demanded the release of their fathers.    ``How can we live without our fathers?'' said Fidda Washah 16 who addressed the rally. Her father Jabar a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine faction has served 14 years of a life sentence for attacking Israeli soldiers.    Netanyahu said he would not release anyone ``with blood on their hands'' or members of the Islamic militant group Hamas.    ``The Palestinians are claiming falsely that I suggested somehow to free murders at Wye'' Netanyahu told reporters.    Israeli officials say only about 110 of the 2500 Palestinian activists behind bars could be let go in the next release scheduled to take place just after Clinton's visit.    Tibi who was spokesman for the Palestinian delegation at Wye Mills Maryland said only about 300 of the Palestinians currently in jail had been involved in attacks that killed Israelis. The rest he described as ``political prisoners.''    He said about 1250 prisoners who were members of various PLO factions and the remainder belonged to Hamas.    ``We would very much like him Clinton to interfere in the issue of Palestinian prisoners'' said Tibi.    Palestinian officials urged residents of the West Bank to confront Israeli bulldozers that are expanding settlements or building roads to link Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank and Israel.    ``Settlement activity should be resisted'' said Tibi. ``Settlers are public enemy No. 1 to Palestinians.''    Several members of the Palestinian legislative council are considering a boycott of Clinton's speech in Gaza City on Dec. 14 to show their anger over a failure by the United States to pressure Israel on the settlement and prisoner issues.    In traditionally Arab east Jerusalem meanwhile Israeli contractors bidding on the Har Homa Jewish housing project in visited the construction site where left-wing Israelis staged a protest. Police detained three demonstrators from the Peace Now group trying to disrupt the tour.    The Palestinians hope to establish a future capital in east Jerusalem. They say Har Homa is part of an Israeli plan to cut off the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem from their hinterland in Bethlehem and the southern West Bank.

<HTML>    THE HAGUE Netherlands AP  The man calling himself the ``Serb Adolf'' seemed to enjoy murdering and torturing hundreds of Muslim prisoners of war a witness testified Tuesday at a U.N. trial.    Goran Jelisic a 30-year-old Bosnian Serb stands accused of genocide before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal. He has already pleaded guilty to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats at a Serbian-run detention camp near the northern Bosnian town of Brcko in 1992.    ``I think he took pleasure in doing this because he was so powerful'' said a 53-year-old Muslim camp survivor identified only as Witness B. ``He said it was nice to kill.''    Although his guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war crimes and crimes against humanity  and the likelihood of a maximum life sentence  Jelisic has denied that the killing spree constituted genocide.    By trying him for genocide U.N. prosecutors will be able to call evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders including the involvement of more senior Serbs.    During the testimony the former mechanic who called himself Adolf sat calmly alternately leaning forward on the table in front of him or slumping in his chair.    A Muslim witness continuing his testimony from Monday's opening day detailed Jelisic's alleged brutality against Muslims.    Jelisic and other camp guards tortured and killed people at will Witness A said calling Jelisic ``a beast.''    ``They simply knew we were Muslims and Croats. They simply wanted to eradicate us'' said Witness A who was allowed to take a short break after he began to sob on the stand.    ``I think this was killing of pleasure out of some kind of hate against my people. Those of us that survived... we all believe he tried to inflict as much pain as possible'' he said.    Set up in 1993 by the U.N. Security Council the tribunal has convicted two Muslims two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder rape and torture but it has yet to register a conviction for genocide the gravest offense the court recognizes.    Jelisic faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for each offense. His trial is expected to last well into 1999.    Another witness said he was taken to the Luka detention camp with two busloads of Muslims. Witness B another Muslim said Jelisic immediately confiscated their identification papers.    Jelisic called out names and said they would be executed. Then he laughed and said he was only joking the witness testified.    Witness B recounted that Jelisic interrogated visitors who said they were visiting inmates for the May Day holiday he accused them of lying the witness said.    ``He said `This will by your last May Day' and took them out and killed them'' the witness said.

<HTML>    JERUSALEM AP  Archeology one of Israel's biggest tourist attractions suffered a blow Tuesday when most of its excavations were shut down.    The Israel Antiquities Authority halted its salvage digs  carried out ahead of most construction projects  after the Supreme Court ruled that developers and builders cannot be billed for these excavations.    In the country of Jesus and King Solomon Richard the Lion Heart and Saladin it is almost impossible to start a building or a road without uncovering ancient remains.    In response to a petition from a developer however the Supreme Court ruled Sunday that the government not the builder must bear the costs of the salvage digs operated by the Antiquities Authority.    In response the Antiquities Authority decided Tuesday to halt all salvage digs which account for about 300 of the 350 excavations carried out in Israel each year.    ``We have no budget for salvage digs'' said Antiquities Authority spokeswoman Osnat Gouez.    Major digs open to the public like those in Jerusalem Caesarea and Beit Shean have been drastically curtailed for lack of government funding Gouez said.    In the archeological sense Israel is the one of the most crowded countries in the world with some 25000 known sites excavated or waiting to be dug up.

<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  President Boris Yeltsin is feeling better but is still spending part of the day in bed as he continues to be treated for pneumonia officials said Tuesday.    A Kremlin spokesman said the president was doing limited paperwork and there were no plans for any meetings or visitors. He did not say how much longer Yeltsin would remain in the government hospital where he has been for 10 days.    Yeltsin met his chief-of-staff Valentin Yumashev in the hospital Monday and was briefed on government and national affairs.    Russian television showed brief footage of Yeltsin dressed in a white shirt and dark cardigan and looking pale listening intently to his aide and nodding periodically. Like most footage of Yeltsin released in recent weeks Monday's tape didn't contain any sound of the president speaking.    Yeltsin's repeated illnesses and his infrequent public appearances have raised concerns about his ability to lead the country  now mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse  through the end of his term in mid-2000.    ren

<HTML>    LONDON AP  More than 500 police officers swarmed a suspected drugs lair used by traffickers to supply millions of pounds dollars of cocaine  in one of the largest raids ever in central London.    Scotland Yard said Wednesday that 39 people were arrested for drugs and drugs-related offenses after the Tuesday night raid on a four-story building on Charing Cross Road the heart of the capital's theater district. Police said the building which had been operating as an unlicensed club was a clearing house for illegal drugs.    ''This has been running for months'' Police Chief Superintendent Jim Overton said. ''Rather than just go for the people in there we are going for the organizers ... We are very pleased with the results so far. It looks very very promising.''    The substances found were still being analyzed and the search of the building was expected to continue throughout Wednesday.    Describing the building as a ''fortified drugs warehouse'' Overton said hundreds of officers were needed because the building was reinforced with steel doors and floors. Two other addresses in London had also been searched in connection with the investigation.    Police released no other information.    mb

<HTML>    GAUHATI India AP  Suspected tribal separatists attacked a Bhutanese general's convoy as it passed through India Tuesday shooting and killing three of his escorts Indian police said.    The general traveling through Indian territory from one part of Bhutan to another was unhurt. Six other soldiers were injured four of them critically in the attack in the Kokila Forest 170 kilometers about 100 miles west of Gauhati capital of Assam state. Police said the attackers were believed to be militants from the Bodo tribe who are active in the region.    It was not clear why the general identified by Indian police only as Brig. Datto was traveling in the volatile region. Bhutanese officials were not immediately available for comment.    Both the Bodo Liberation Tiger Force and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland want to carve out a separate Bodoland from Indian territory for the Bodos who are nearly 1.2 million of Assam's 22 million people. The militants are entrenched in camps in southern Bhutan from where they stage hit-and-run attacks on Indian security forces.    But it is rare for Bodo militants to strike Bhutanese forces and risk antagonizing a government that has so far been careful to stay out of the Indian dispute. The attackers may have thought the relatively large escort accompanying the general was part of an offensive.    India says hundreds of guerrillas from its northeastern state of Assam have set up camps in southern Bhutan. The Indian army is forbidden to give chase across the frontier because that would violate Bhutanese sovereignty. Bhutan says it does not want to give the guerrillas sanctuary but its own army of just 6000 fighters is unable to secure the area.    Bhutan is believed to fear that if it allows India to attack the guerrilla bases the rebels will retaliate by cutting off its vital road links to India.    Bhutan relies on India for 85 percent of its imports and for tens of millions of dollars in development aid annually. The guerrilla bases are a rare point of discord between India and Bhutan the closest allies among the countries of South Asia.

<HTML>    MONTREAL AP  Quebec's pro-independence government was re-elected but won only about 43 percent of the popular vote likely dampening its zest for holding a secession referendum any time soon.    The outcome of Monday's vote means a new term of up to five years for Quebec's charismatic premier Lucien Bouchard who says he will call a referendum on independence whenever he feels the separatist side can win.    But he may need to wait a while for what he calls the ``winning conditions.'' His Parti Quebecois retained its big majority in the legislature but was narrowly outpolled in the popular vote by its anti-separatist rival the Quebec Liberal Party.    With almost all 23000 polling stations reporting late Monday the separatists had 42.7 percent of the votes to 43.7 percent for the Liberals and 12 percent for a third party Democratic Action.    But despite the close popular vote the Liberals lagged far behind in the individual races for seats in the legislature because their support was heavily concentrated in a few areas of the province. The Parti Quebecois ran well among French-speakers in most areas of the province.    The separatists were on track to win 75 of the legislature's 125 seats the Liberals 48 and Democratic Action one with one seat to be filled later because the separatist candidate recently died.    The outcome was a virtual replay of 1994 when the separatists won 77 seats to 47 for the Liberals while each receiving about 44 percent of the popular vote.    Bouchard in his victory speech paid tribute to his opponents and pledged to work with them on policy matters. But he also promised to work for the ``winning conditions'' that would make independence possible.    ``Our first priority is to advance Quebec ... to push it farther toward its destiny'' he said.    Bouchard's main rival was Liberal party leader Jean Charest who tried to convince voters that the province would prosper only if the decades-old threat of secession was abandoned.    Charest 40 became an early favorite when he quit federal politics in March to enter the Quebec race; in English-speaking Canada he was viewed as the potential savior of national unity.    He then dropped behind in the polls and appeared relieved by his party's strong showing in the popular vote.    ``The result tonight ... reflects the fact that the people of Quebec like the people of all Canada want this country of ours to work and be a success'' he told supporters in his home district of Sherbrooke.    Charest confirmed that would stay on as Liberal leader in the legislature.    Bouchard 59 has maintained high popularity ratings despite overseeing painful spending cuts over the past three years in a drive to erase Quebec's deficit. Among Francophones he has never lost the mythic aura he gained when after losing a leg and almost dying from a flesh-eating disease in 1994 he came back to lead the separatists to near-victory in a 1995 referendum on secession.    Though Bouchard has served in the federal Cabinet and federal Parliament this was the first time he ever ran as a party leader in Quebec. He was appointed premier without an election in 1996 after his predecessor Jacques Parizeau resigned following the 1995 referendum.    There were 5.2 million eligible voters Monday and turnout was more than 80 percent even though this was the fourth province-wide vote in the past five years.    Analysts had suggested that a landslide separatist victory  approaching 50 percent of the popular vote  would lead to pressure from Parti Quebecois militants to hold a secession referendum quickly. Monday's results were considered more likely to prompt a cautious approach from Bouchard and perhaps a wait of a year or two before considering a referendum.    The separatists have lost secession referendums twice before once by a big margin in 1980 and just narrowly in 1995.    Bouchard anxious to avoid a third defeat said he would call another referendum only when he was convinced the separatists would win. In the meantime he says he would seek more autonomy for all 10 provinces particularly in regard to control over social programs.    Many Quebeckers supported Bouchard even though they oppose secession. Polls suggest only about 43 percent of Quebec voters would support independence now and about two-thirds do not want a referendum on secession in the next few years.    To woo these voters Bouchard tried to portray the election as the choice of the most competent leadership with the thorny question of a referendum to be addressed at a later date.    The Liberals' chances clearly were hurt by the relatively strong showing of Democratic Action whose leader 28-year-old Mario Dumont retained his seat in the legislature. His party which appeals to many young voters favors greater autonomy for Quebec but stops short of advocating outright secession.    About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from southern Europe Asia and elsewhere.    The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is different from the rest of Canada plus a yearning to manage their own affairs and have their own national symbols.

<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  A wide coalition of democratic leaders seeking to prevent Communists from returning to power will soon be officially inaugurated a member of the group said Tuesday.    The founding conference of the umbrella group ``should take place in the near future'' said Oleg Sysuyev the deputy head of the Kremlin administration who called for forming the coalition.    A declaration signed last week ``calls for uniting democratic forces for combating extremism and fascism'' he said.    The idea for the coalition has gathered strength since the killing of outspoken liberal lawmaker Galina Starovoitova on Nov. 20. Sysuyev has said President Boris Yeltsin endorsed the idea.    Her death focused the fears of Russia's splintered liberals that they might lose more power to Communist or nationalist forces.    Other organizers of the coalition include Yegor Gaidar former prime minister and leader of the reformist party Democratic Russia former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and ex-deputy premiers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov.    The group calls itself a ``center-right'' bloc  a term Russian liberals use to distance themselves from Communists who heavily dominate the ``left'' of Russia's skewed political spectrum.    Russian liberal groups have been torn apart by rivalry in the past and the prospects of their union remained unclear.    Parliament speaker Gennady Seleznyov a Communist has predicted that the group will quickly self-destruct in a battle over leadership.    ad/adc

<HTML>    BRUSSELS Belgium AP - Hopes of a reprieve for duty free sales for travelers within the European Union rose Tuesday as support for a planned abolition appeared to fade among EU finance ministers.    France proposed extending the life of the popular tax-free sales on flights ports and ferry crossings for five years beyond June 30 1999 when the EU is scheduled to scrap them. Germany and Britain expressed support for the proposal.    However any bid to save duty-free shopping needs the backing of all 15 EU nations and not all were ready to agree. Swedish Finance Minister Erik Asbrink was one who refused to budge. ``The position is unchanged'' he told reporters.    In 1991 EU nations all voted to abolish the tax free shopping claiming it was incompatible with the notion of a borderless EU market. Now they need unanimity to reverse that decision.    Airlines shipping companies and labor unions have pursued a high-profile campaign to reverse save duty-free. They claimed abolition of the dlrs 6.4-billion-a-year duty free industry will push up the cost of travel and throw some 150000 people out of work.    The EU Commission argues that duty-free operators effectively enjoy a subsidy of dlrs 2.2 billion a year by not paying duties on their sales giving them an unfair advantage over other retailers.    The ban only affects sales for travelers within the EU. Those traveling to or from the Union will still be able to enjoy tax free shopping.  UR; pa-rac

<HTML>    CARACAS Venezuela AP  A former Miss Universe said Tuesday she will stay in the race to become Venezuela's next president despite losing the backing of one of the country's major political parties.    Irene Saez 36 said she accepted Monday's decision by the center-right COPEI party to throw its support to former state governor Henrique Salas Romer but would compete in next Sunday's election as an independent.    ``I respect the decision and I return the card that never belonged to me'' Saez said referring to COPEI's box on the electoral ballot.    The move by COPEI was part of strategy to foil the presidential aspirations of retired Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez who led an abortive coup in 1992. COPEI said Saez's candidacy threatened to divide the anti-Chavez vote.    Fearing that Chavez would impose a dictatorship if elected COPEI and Venezuela's other major party Democratic Action have closed ranks around Salas.    Over the weekend Democratic Action also dropped its candidate 77-year-old party stalwart Luis Alfaro who is fighting the decision.    Millions of Venezuela's poor see Chavez as a hero partly because of his tough talk on corruption and his promises to slow down free-market reforms.    Chavez's Patriotic Pole coalition won a plurality of seats in Venezuela's Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections prompting his opponents to form a coalition of their own dubbed the ``Democratic Pole.''    Speaking to hundreds of supporters at her campaign headquarters Tuesday Saez said she laments the nation's increasing political polarization.    ``We are all democratic and we are all patriotic. We are one people'' Saez said.    She acknowledged she has little chance of winning but said she wants to give voters an alternative for democratic change.    Saez a 6-foot-1 1.85-meter strawberry blonde who was Miss Universe 1981 had led the polls for months. As mayor of affluent Chacao municipality in Caracas she built a reputation as an honest and efficient politician.    But sugary slogans confusion among her campaign team and her decision to accept COPEI's backing has seen her popularity plummet in recent polls.

<HTML>    KUWAIT AP  Former U.S. President George Bush arrived in Kuwait on Monday for a brief visit his third to a country that idolizes him as the hero of the 1991 Gulf War that ended a seven-month Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.    Although Bush's visit is a private one he was greeted at the airport by the crown prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah.    The former president planned to meet with U.S. Army troops stationed at Camp Doha north of Kuwait City. They maintain equipment prepositioned here to be used to defend Kuwait against any further Iraqi aggression.    Bush who is accompanied by a group of investors is to meet the emir Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah and attend a dinner with Kuwaiti dignitaries and businessmen. He leaves early Wednesday.    Security is tight and the press has been told it will have no access to Bush during the visit.    When Bush first came to Kuwait in April 1993 authorities uncovered a plot to assassinate him. Two Iraqis were sentenced to death in connection with the plot and several others were given prison terms.    Bush earlier visited Egypt and Saudi Arabia.  UR; de-eap

<HTML>    JOHANNESBURG South Africa AP  Activists across the globe marched in the streets distributed condoms and held benefit concerts Tuesday to try to halt the spread of AIDS which will kill millions of people this year alone.    Underscoring events on World AIDS Day was this sobering fact: Although powerful new medicines are helping industrialized countries win the battle against the disease it has reached epidemic proportions in continents where people can't afford the drugs.    About 33.4 million people around the world are infected with HIV two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia and the Pacific 700000 people become infected with HIV per year.    In sub-Saharan Africa the 1998 death toll from AIDS is expected to be 2 million. Nearly 6 million more people will become infected this year  1.7 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa.    ``In the case of HIV/AIDS the difference in wealth becomes literally matter of life and death'' decried Mary Robinson the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.    From bars in Hong Kong to parks in South Africa activists preached safe sex. People pinned red ribbons on lapels to express solidarity in the fight against AIDS. In San Juan Puerto Rico more than 3000 people formed a human red ribbon.    ``It's important to be here to urge people to say `No' to AIDS and to protect themselves'' said Carlos Baerga a free agent baseball player most recently with the New York Mets. Those whose loved ones died from AIDS planned to toss carnations into the Atlantic Ocean in their memory.     In India where up to 5 million people are HIV positive hundreds of schoolchildren marched beside prostitutes in New Delhi to draw attention to the epidemic.     Israelis and Palestinians handed out condoms and literature to passengers departing Israel's international airport in Tel Aviv.     In Ivory Coast thousands of children wearing T-shirts with anti-AIDS slogans and bouncing inflated condoms like beach balls marched through the streets of Abidjan.     In Kenya children wearing black T-Shirts that said ``Stop AIDS'' distributed condoms and pamphlets on AIDS prevention in Dandora an eastern Nairobi slum.     In Hong Kong's nightspots activists handed out coasters with pictures of a condom on one side and a safe-sex message on the other.     In Tokyo Japan's Health Ministry held rallies and concerts in a central square.     In Moscow a contraceptive company's employees sheathed in red yellow or green ``condom suits'' handed out condoms in Pushkin Square.     In Pretoria South Africa clowns painted red AIDS ribbons on people's faces as drum majorettes entertained a crowd.    Underneath it all was a life-and-death message: Practice safe sex or face the consequences.    ``Come and witness the reality of AIDS. See the devastation in our community. See the fresh graves'' South African President Nelson Mandela told hundreds of people in a village in KwaZulu-Natal province where an estimated 25 percent of adults are infected with HIV.    But considering the enormity of the problem the call to action worldwide was muted.    In some countries like Zimbabwe where an estimated 23 percent of the population is infected with HIV World AIDS day passed with little fanfare. Countries in southern Africa have been slow to recognize the unfolding tragedy and have little resources to fight it.    It was only in October that the South African government launched an AIDS awareness program. Already more than 3 million South Africans are infected. This year an estimated 168000 have died from AIDS.    The vast majority of those infected in Africa and other developing regions cannot afford the drugs that are prolonging life among AIDS patients in the West.    In Washington President Bill Clinton announced dlrs 10 million in emergency grants to help children orphaned by AIDS in poorer nations. Much more assistance would be needed to help turn the tide.    Robinson the top human rights official at the U.N. said: ``The current situation is an indictment of the international allocation of resources to fight HIV/AIDS in developing nations.''    var-aos

<HTML>    KHARTOUM Sudan AP  The United Nations World Food Program has sent about 2500 tons of relief aid for hungry civilians in war-torn southern Sudan a U.N. official said Tuesday.    A convoy of seven river barges carrying relief material left the river port of Kosti 300 kilometers miles 195 south of Khartoum on Monday to distribute the aid to people along the Nile river the WFP representative in Khartoum Mohammed Saleheen said in a statement.    The statement said WFP teams will distribute relief to some 33 locations under government and rebel control until the convoy reaches the southern strategic town of Juba early January.    Juba a provincial capital about 1200 kilometers 744 miles south of the Sudanese capital Khartoum is the largest town in southern Sudan still under government control.    Saleheen said the WFP intends to send more aid in the coming months via the Nile as it is much cheaper than air transport.    The WFP used to drop 9500 tons of food a month at a cost of dlrs 30 million into the south in the world's largest aid operation.    Aid workers estimate about 1.5 million people are facing severe food shortages in southern Sudan mainly in Bahr el-Ghazal province as a result of drought and fighting.    The government and the rebels agreed in October to extend by three months a cease-fire to allow food to reach civilians caught in the war with the rebels in the south.    Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war for 15 years pitting Christian and animist rebels fighting for more autonomy against the government in the Muslim Arab north. About 1.5 million people have died in the war and famines caused by the fighting.

The graying former hippie guru fighting U.S. efforts to get him extradited back to Pennsylvania tried to persuade the judge of his innocence even though a U.S. court has found him guilty.    ``One thing'' Einhorn said pointing emphatically as he took the stand for his sole declaration. ``I did not kill Holly Maddux. C'est tout. That's all.''    The victim's family occasionally glared Einhorn before the judge deferred a decision on the extradition request - the second by the United States - until Jan. 12.    A prominent anti-war campaigner and activist in the 1960s Einhorn now 57 fled the United States shortly before his trial. But after 16 years in hiding he was tracked down and arrested at his French home in June 1997.    Elisabeth Hall the victim's sister traveled from Texas for the hearing with her two sisters and brother. She said the experience left her cold.    ``He was smirking as he said it'' Hall said. ``It was a clear attempt to provoke some kind of outburst. He's a pitiful character and he knows exactly what he's done.''    It was the first time in 20 years that the family saw Einhorn.    ``It was somewhat anti-climactic because I did not feel a surge of anger'' Hall said. ``But he was intimidated by our presence.''    When Maddux a former cheerleader from Tyler Texas disappeared Einhorn said she had gone shopping and never returned.    But 18 months later neighbors told police of a stench coming from Einhorn's apartment and Maddux's battered remains were found. Forensic experts said her skull had been smashed six times.    Maddux's family said they would consider returning to France in January and would continue to appeal if France rejects the extradition.    ``We are here in France to remind the judges that underneath all this international law and political squabbling there is a person who was murdered and who looks like us'' Hall said.    ``Anybody can see there has been a definite undercurrent of anti-Americanism'' she said.    A French court refused to extradite Einhorn in December 1997 citing a French law that would have required a retrial if he was extradited. Pennsylvania then passed a law promising Einhorn a retrial. He was re-arrested in September.    His defense lawyers argue that if extradited Einhorn could face the death penalty which is banned under French law. They also claim Pennsylvania courts might withdraw the pledge of a retrial.    ``This is not a matter of judging U.S. law'' said prosecution lawyer Francois Munch. ``This is a matter of finding who killed Holly Maddux.''    In a November interview on ABC television Einhorn declared his innocence and claimed the CIA or KGB framed him after he uncovered classified mind-control experiments.    ip-cb

<HTML>    BANGKOK Thailand AP  Excavation has begun for about 7000 graves of Japanese soldiers who perished during World War II the Japanese embassy said Wednesday.    Japan's Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare is sponsoring the excavation in hopes of identifying some of the soldiers and providing answers for families of soldiers still listed as missing said Hideki Yamada first secretary at the embassy in Bangkok.    The site near Mae Hong Son 650 kilometers 404 miles north of Bangkok and near the border with Myanmar is an abandoned cemetery of Japan's Imperial Army.    The Japanese government only learned of its existence earlier this year Yamada said.    The soldiers died as they trekked out of Myanmar then known as Burma after the Japanese surrendered in 1945.    The Thai workers hired by the Japanese government performed Buddhist religious rites Tuesday before beginning the five-day dig.

<HTML>    LONDON AP  German President Roman Herzog kicked off a four-day state visit at Windsor Castle Tuesday by viewing a giant handmade gilded orb and cross created by British craftsmen for the people of Dresden as a symbol of friendship and reconciliation over World War II.    The 18-foot 5.5- meter orb and cross is a replica of the ornament that once graced the skyline of Dresden atop the Baroque Frauenkirche. The original was destroyed when the church was reduced to rubble in a two-day Anglo-American bomb raid on the city during World War II.    The 1.5 ton copper and stainless steel creation was made by hand in the old-fashioned way as requested by the people of Dresden. It was commissioned by the Dresden Trust a group of people in Britain who raised around 300000 pounds dlrs 495000 from individuals charities and companies across the country.    Herzog and his wife Christiane are the first to be entertained by Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle since fire ripped through it in 1992 destroying some of its historic sections.    The Herzogs were met at London's Heathrow Airport by the queen's cousin the Duke of Kent and escorted to join the queen and her husband Prince Phillip for a carriage procession through the streets of Windsor and into the castle as crowds lined the streets to look on.    But before the procession reached the gates of the castle a cavalryman escorting the carriages was thrown from his horse when it reared. The rider who was wearing a heavy breastplate and armor fell on a sanded road infront of the queen's carriage. He was taken to a local hospital with shoulder and spine injuries.    ``The incident did not delay the procession but did cause a short delay to the military band entering the castle'' said a spokeswoman for Thames Valley Police speaking on customary condition of anonymity.    The Herzogs were scheduled to visit a German school and have tea with the Queen Mother Elizabeth before attending a state banquet at the castle where they are staying.    Other stops scheduled for later in the tour include Edinburgh Castle and the queen's Holyroodhouse palace in Scotland as well as museums art galleries churches and hospitals.    Herzog will meet with Prime Minister Tony Blair and other political leaders and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey.    The Herzogs were also expected to attend the premiere of a German film in London on their final night and Mrs. Herzog was to visit Burberry's the clothing store.    The last state visit by a German president was in July 1986 by President Richard von Weizsacker. The queen last paid a state visit to Germany in 1992.    er

<HTML>    TURIN Italy AP  Juventus general director Luciano Moggi on Tuesday defended as ``well grounded'' the club decision to travel to Istanbul on game day for the politically tinged European Champions League match against Galatasaray.    The Italian league champions who need a victory to keep its quarterfinal chances alive have decided to travel to Istanbul on Wednesday and return home immediately after the game.    UEFA Europe's governing body for soccer requires teams to arrive the day before of European Cup matches and was critical of Juventus' decision.    ``Juventus feels there are well grounded motives for failing to conform to UEFA directives'' Moggi sauid.    Juventus confirmed on Tuesday its travel plans for the match which was postponed by a week after anti-Italian demonstrations erupted in Turkey over Italy's refusal to extradite Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.    Several Juventus players who had initially refused to travel to Instanbul bowed to the club decision to play Galatasaray but criticized the UEFA stand.    ``We have been forced to play a game conditioned by political motives'' Juventus starting goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi said.    Team captain Antonio Conte said Tuesday that the Italian government and UEFA left the Italian team standing alone.    ``UEFA and the Italian government have claimed that there are no security problems in Istanbul ... but as far as we know no UEFA and government representatives will be in Istanbul Wednesday'' Conte told the Italian news agency ANSA.    However Italian culture minister Giovanna Melandri who was invited to attend the game by her Turkish counterpart on Tuesday afternoon accepted the offer and said she was going to the game.    ``I'm convinced that sports must always and in any case represent a moment of encounter. I hope I'll be attending a great match'' Melandri was quoted as saying.    Anti-Italian sentiment in Turkey over the Ocalan issue raised fears among Italian business owners that Turks might boycott Italian goods.

<HTML>    PORT MORESBY Papua New Guinea AP  The power blackout in Papua New Guinea continued for the second day forced by a nationwide strike by trade unions protesting the government's budget.    The strike was called last Friday to demand Prime Minister Bill Skate to redraft next year's budget which slashes spending across most government departments axes 7000 public service jobs and abolishes key research institutions.    About 1300 workers for the main power supplier Elcom have cut power to all homes and businesses throughout the country from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.    Elcom National Staff Association general secretary Philip Kaira said it may begin targeting the blackout at only customers who owe large sums of money to Elcom in unpaid bills.    Kaira said the unions may disconnect power supplies to government buildings and offices including the Parliament House in Port Moresby.    Skate who has refused to redraft the budget says the strike is politically motivated and illegal.

<HTML>    SINGAPORE AP  Asia's first sextuplets astonished their Indonesian parents and Singapore doctors who expected five babies instead of six a newspaper reported Tuesday.    One girl and five boys were delivered by Caesarean section during a one-hour operation at Singapore's Gleneagles Hospital on Friday.    ``I was stunned and overjoyed when the nurse ran out of the operation theater and told me I had not five but six babies'' Indonesian businessman Andre Prijono 30 was quoted as saying Monday by The Straits Times.    Prijono and his wife 26-year-old Susan Tjokrosetio underwent fertility treatment in March. Nature caught up with the first-time parents in November.    Daughter Deidree was delivered first followed by brothers Danny Davis Dylon and Douglas. The doctor only discovered Dominick as he prepared for a post-delivery procedure.    ``I was about to remove the unusually heavy placenta when hello I saw a baby's knee among the membranes'' fertility expert Dr. Christopher Chen was quoted as saying.    Five fetuses had appeared during ultrasound scans said Chen who added that the hospital had only prepared a corresponding number of incubators and doctors to care for each child.    ``We hoped for one pregnancy but we ended up with six'' said Chen. ``I had not known that both parents had family records of multiple pregnancies.''    The babies weighed between 1.26 and 1.82 kilograms 2.77 and 4.00 pounds at birth and were carried by their mother for a record 33 weeks said the report.    ``The nurses say my wife's a superwoman but we aren't planning any more children for the moment'' said Prijono on Monday.

<HTML>    TOKYO AP  Nobuyuki Asai had pretty much expected he would get a job offer from Japan's biggest telecommunications company before his high school graduation next spring.    Although not a stellar student Asai had reason to be optimistic. In the past every senior at Adachi High who wanted a job had found one by mid-September.    The offer never came. Of the nearly 50 Adachi students looking for work this year six are still searching and 10 have given up and decided to go to vocational schools.    With Japan's economy wilting a growing legion of disillusioned teen-agers is finding the country's work force has no room for them  spawning fears that if things don't improve Japan could soon be paying the price in increased crime and poverty.    Unemployment for young Japanese between 15- and 19-years-old is about 10 percent the highest since the government began tracking the figure in 1968 and far above the 4.3 percent rate for the general population.    It is better than the United States where the teen jobless rate is about 15 percent. But near zero unemployment has long been one of the pillars of Japan's postwar economic growth and a key to the low crime rates and social stability Japanese have grown accustomed to.    ``It's a state of emergency'' said Ryo Mino an official in the Education Ministry. ``We are extremely worried.''    Education officials say a major concern is a growing rootlessness among teens who no longer desire the job security and social standing that are so important to their parents. Many instead float from one part-time job to another.    Juvenile crime  although low compared to the United States and other Western nations  has been rising. The number of juveniles committing murder rape and other serious crimes jumped to 2263 in 1997 up 51 percent from the year before. The number rose an additional 10 percent during the first half of this year.    Disillusionment and restlessness are particularly high among teens who aren't on track to get into the best universities.    Adachi High  a drab gray school on the slummy side of Tokyo where railroad tracks crisscross a muddy river  sends few of its graduates to the top four-year colleges.    Instead most of the students typical teens with a weakness for baggy jeans and karaoke parties end up in less prestigious colleges or trade schools.    But not until this year did the possibility of being left out in the cold become a reality.    Job offers for prospective high school graduates in the district plummeted 35 percent. The drop was especially drastic in the ailing financial sector where offers fell from 52 to just nine.    With the recession worsening salesclerk jobs that previously went to high school graduates are being snatched up by those with university and junior college degrees.    Such economic changes are hard for today's youth to grasp.    ``These kids grew up in affluence'' said Kokichi Arai a guidance counselor at Adachi High. ``Their parents gave them money and lots of material things. They think jobs are easy to come by.''    Kazuyuki Kageyama of the unemployment office for the Adachi district said youngsters are starting to simply give up.    Over the last three years seniors in the Adachi district with no interest in either going to college or finding full-time employment have more than doubled. Most of them end up with part-time jobs.    ``Fortunately there are still lots of part-time jobs for these kids'' Kageyama said. ``But I fear what the future holds could be dangerous.''    Asai a cheerful 17-year-old who plays the tuba for his award-winning high school band had once hoped to go to college. But when his father's demolition business failed several years ago  a casualty of the recession  Asai realized he'd have to let that dream go.    Then the hoped-for telecommunications job didn't materialize.   Finally his guidance counselor found Asai a spot at a small computer firm run by an Adachi graduate.    ``It was like there was no chance for us from the beginning'' Asai said. ``Having just a high school degree was a big drawback.''

<HTML>    BRUSSELS Belgium AP  With just a month to go before the launch of the euro European Union finance ministers reached an 11th-hour agreement Tuesday on who should speak for the single-currency bloc on the world stage.    The agreement resolved months of deadlock between big and small euro-zone nations over representation of the 11-nation currency bloc at the G-7 group of world economic powers and other international bodies.    Under the compromise the euro-zone's three existing G-7 nations - Germany France and Italy - keep their seats and will take turns to represent the bloc. Smaller nations will get to sit alongside them at G-7 meetings when they hold the rotating euro-zone presidency.    German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine will therefore speak for the euro-zone for the first six months of 1999 to be joined by his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niniisto for second half of the year.    Wim Duisenberg president of the new European Central Bank will get a G-7 seat. But the EU's executive Commission will offered only a ``technical support'' role.    The launch of the euro as the shared currency of 11 EU nations on Jan. 1 will create a single bloc that will rival the United States and Japan as a global economic power.    But while U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa can always get on the phone to discuss the world economic situation nobody was sure whom to call when they want to speak to the euro-bloc.    The rotating system of euro-zone presidencies should go some way to meeting that need. The deal is set to be confirmed by EU leaders at their year-end summit next week in Vienna. Details of how the euro-zone will be represented at the International Monetary Fund and other world bodies are also expected to be finalized in the Austrian capital.    There was no immediate reaction from other G-7 nations - the United States Japan and Canada  who must agree to the proposal. Lafontaine is scheduled to present the proposal at a meeting Friday with Rubin and U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan Friday in Washington.    ``It was very important that we defined the rules before the end of the year'' said French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn. ``I think the Americans will go along with it.''    If accepted the new system will be applied at a G-7 finance ministers and central bankers meeting Feb. 20 in Bonn Germany. Britain the EU's fourth G-7 member is staying out of the euro.    The EU ministers also called for an acceleration of efforts to close corporate tax loopholes that cost national treasuries billions of dollars in lost revenue. But differences remained over talk of a wider harmonization of tax policies.    Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown repeated British opposition to French and German suggestions of EU-wide tax levels. ``There is no reason why the single currency should mean the same tax rates across Europe'' he told reporters.

<HTML>    ISTANBUL Turkey AP  Authorities assigned more than 20000 policemen to a politically charged Champions League match Wednesday pitting Juventus of Italy against Turkey's Galatasaray.    ``We will do our best to start and finish the game without any incidents'' Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas told reporters Tuesday. ``Everyone should know that this is a sports competition.''    The tight security measures are intended to protect Juventus players from any possible acts by Turks angry at Italy for refusing to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader.    Italy has declined to return Ocalan who was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12 because he faces the death penalty in Turkey for capital crimes. Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey for 14 years and the Turkish government holds him responsible for thousands of deaths.    Aktas said that police will use a heavy hand against troublemakers warning that ``whoever gets involved in provocative acts will be severely punished.''    Private NTV television said some 22000 policemen were assigned to the match. Aktas said military units would also be called in.    The game will be played after a one-week postponement by European soccer's governing body UEFA for security concerns. Tension has declined since then.    Mass circulation dailies also called on the fans to stay calm.    ``Welcome Juve'' headlined the daily Hurriyet in Italian saying Turks would put to shame those who have said Turkey was unsafe by showing ``maturity and hospitality.''    NTV said police would search spectators entering the Ali Sami Yen stadium for knives and clubs. Banners and fireworks are also banned.    Roads to be used by Juventus players will be cordoned off daily Milliyet said.    But it was not clear if the measures would ease Juventus' concerns.    Juventus general director Luiciano Moggi said Monday that they ``will not be going calmly'' to Istanbul.    In a concession to the players' misgivings the club announced it would fly to Istanbul hours before the game and depart immediately after the match. Juventus had planned to head to Istanbul on Tuesday.    Several Juventus players including French World Cup hero Zinedine Zidane had threatened to refuse to play in Istanbul.    ``We were kind of forced to go to play. We're very worried'' Juventus 'keeper Angelo Peruzzi said Monday. ``UEFA and the Italian and Turkish governments know that they have taken on a big responsibility.''    Prior to the UEFA postponement demonstrators set fire to a Fiat car a motorbike and numerous Italian flags.    Galatasaray has accused UEFA of favoring the Italian team by postponing the game and allegedly giving injured Juventus players time to recover.    Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim vowed to defeat Juve.    ``Hopefully we will write history'' sports daily Foto Mac quoted Terim as saying Tuesday. ``Italians will return empty handed.''    Romanian striker Gheorghe Hagi of Galatasaray was more cautious.    ``Ignoring Juventus' power would be suicide'' Hagi said.    Galatasaray has seven points in Group B one behind Norway's Rosenborg. Juventus has four but both teams have played one fewer game than the Norwegians.    sh/vls

<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  With Russia's leaders urgently seeking financial help International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus began two days of talks in Moscow on Tuesday on Russia's frozen loan agreement with the IMF.    Camdessus met Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov later Tuesday and is scheduled to hold broader talks with government officials Wednesday.    ``I want to get better acquainted with the prime minister'' Camdessus told reporters upon arrival in Moscow on Tuesday night. ``I presume we will be having interesting conversations.''    President Boris Yeltsin who is in the hospital receiving treatment for pneumonia on Tuesday spoke with Primakov by telephone to discuss the government's stance at the talks with Camdessus.    Russia is seeking further installments on an IMF bailout package that was reached in the summer but was frozen after the government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August. The IMF has said the government must come up with a realistic recovery plan before more money will be released.    Camdessus is not expected to announce any breakthroughs but his visit does give Russia an opportunity to make its case and lobby for fresh funds.    The bailout package totals dlrs 22.6 billion and also involves the World Bank and the Japanese government but Russia has so far received only about dlrs 5 billion.    An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer subsidies to ailing industries.    ``The IMF has plenty of reasons to say to Russia `you guys want to borrow money from us while cutting taxes without having learned how to collect them''' the liberal daily Vremya said Tuesday.    If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon it will probably have to start printing money which would drive up inflation.    ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid hyperinflation'' Oleg Sysuyev a top presidential aide was quoted as saying Tuesday by the Interfax news agency.    The government has been delaying a debate on next year's budget as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet its expenses. The Cabinet again delayed the discussion this week but insisted the delay was not connected with Camdessus' visit.    However the Russian media claimed the government put off action on the budget because it is still hoping for the IMF loans.    ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague and their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit'' the business daily Kommersant said Tuesday.    Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko who was on a trip to the United States this week said Russia wouldn't be able to pay dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt that comes due next year.    ``The IMF must realize that and accept compromises with Russia in reaching agreements on restructuring foreign debts'' Kiriyenko said at New York University on Monday according to the Interfax news agency.    vi/gm/adc

<HTML>    NEWCASTLE England AP  The two former Newcastle United directors who stepped down in disgrace after making disparaging remarks about the club's supporters and the city's women are seeking to be reinstated.    Douglas Hall and Freddy Shepherd launched a bid Tuesday to return to the company board of the Premier League club.    Hall and Shepherd left the board last season after being caught on film mocking Newcastle fans for paying high prices for club merchandise describing Newcastle women as ``dogs'' and calling star striker Alan Shearer ``Mary Poppins.''    Hall's Cameron Hall Developments which owns 57 percent of the club has proposed that the two former bosses be brought back.    The pair want to replace their representatives on the board John Fender and Tom Fenton.    While the move will go before a vote of shareholders Hall's holding combined with the 8.1 percent owned by a trust run by Shepherd means the pair can easily vote themselves back onto the board.    Chairman Dennis Cassidy delayed the company's Annual General Meeting to give remaining shareholders a chance to consider the plan. The meeting was originally scheduled for next Monday.    The two were reinstated to the soccer club board in July but not to the main company board.    sw

<HTML>    SEOUL South Korea AP  In a move that will facilitate organ transplants South Korea plans to recognize a brain dead person as legally dead beginning next year.    The Ministry of Health and Welfare said Wednesday that legislation will be enacted this month to legalize transplants of the heart liver and other vital organs from a brain dead person.    Currently the heart must have stopped for a person to be recognized as dead.    The legislation calls for the establishment of medical teams of up to 10 members at the nation's major hospitals to decide whether a person is brain dead.    A centralized organ donor center will also be established to ease the matching of donors to recipients.    With two ruling coalition parties enjoying a majority in the National Assembly and backing from the main opposition party the bill is expected to be passed without difficulty.

<HTML>    MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN California AP  Howitzers welcomed World Cup ski racers to this California resort on Tuesday as workers tried to clear mountain drifts from a 2-foot 0.6-meter snowfall overnight.    The guns could well have been a 21-gun salute for the powerful Austrian women's team which swept two downhills and a super-G last weekend at Lake Louise Alberta.    Austrian women have won four of the six races so far and with this resort playing host to a super-G and a slalom this week there's every reason to think the ``Power Team'' can add to its laurels.    A year ago it was the German team that swept all before it and even though two-time World Cup overall champion Katja Seizinger is out with a knee injury the remaining members aren't quite ready to hand all the laurels to Austria.    ``Mammoth Mountain is a very good slope for me steep and difficult'' said Hilde Gerg third the last two years in the overall standings and with a victory a second a third and a fifth from previous visits here    Gerg was third in the super-G behind Austrian Alexandra Meissnitzer and teammates Martina Ertl and Regina Haeusl each had fourths in the downhills won both days by Renate Goetschl. While not victories those placements are giving the Germans hope early in the season.    ``I think we can come more and more and get better'' Gerg said.    ``Last year I was third in the overall and you think this year you can perhaps be second or even first but it's not easy. You have to look at how the other girls are skiing. Alexandra Meissnitzer is skiing very well at the moment. But it's a long season and we will see.''    Although the German women have been very good in the 1990s last year ``was a dream season for us'' said Gerg who added a gold medal in slalom and a bronze in the combined in the Olympics at Nagano Japan.    ``What happened happened. The success I've had nobody can take it from me. It's mine'' she said. ``But we also want to continue to ski well. We want to say it wasn't only one season.    ``It's very nice to have it but now it's not going to be so easy. But I think it's good to have to fight; it's not so bad if it's not always so easy.''    Gerg admits that some of Germany's early problems can be blamed on Seizinger's absence.    ``Every girl is skiing for herself but on the team it's not so easy to tell who is the leader'' she said. ``With Katja it was always easy; if she said something that meant it was right.''

<HTML>    BRUSSELS Belgium AP  European Union finance ministers failed Tuesday to narrow differences over how to pay for plans to bring up to 12 new members into the Union over the coming decade.    British French and German ministers said there was growing support for plans to freeze EU spending up to 2006 around current levels of 85 billion European currency units dlrs 100 billion a year.    But less well off EU members  Spain Portugal Greece and Ireland  are seeking an increase in spending to ensure they don't lose out when even poorer nations in central and eastern Europe join the club.    ``It is a difficult area sufficient progress has not been made'' said Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger who chaired the day-long meeting.    The finance ministers had hoped to draw up guidelines on the budget debate to the leaders of the 15 EU nations who hold their year-end summit next week in Vienna.    Although the leaders are hoping to move the issue forward in the Austrian capital they have set a deadline of next Spring to overhaul the budget.    Complicating the question are demands by Germany the Netherlands Austria and Sweden for a reduction in their membership dues to the EU.

<HTML>     UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Honduras restoring civil liberties judge saying pilot caused helicopter crash that killed mayor.  UR; By JULIE WATSON QC;   UR; Associated Press Writer QC;     TEGUCIGALPA Honduras AP  Honduras announced Tuesday that it suspended a governor for inflating her region's death toll from Hurricane Mitch and lowered its official death count by 1350 people.    The new death toll of 5657 was compiled after the government sent teams to verify reports from regions across Honduras the Interior Secretariat said Tuesday.    The governor Lucila Esperanza Barahona de Castro of the Santa Barbara region in remote northwestern Honduras was suspended after investigators could verify only 282 of the 1159 deaths reported in her area.    Authorities said the suspension was standard procedure during an inquiry.    Barahona told The Associated Press she couldn't have falsified the numbers because she didn't even give a death toll to the federal government.    ``I don't know what source gave them the numbers'' she said Tuesday.    In addition to the 5657 dead Honduras said it had verified 8058 missing 12272 injured and 1.4 million homeless throughout the country.    Aid workers and journalists began questioning Honduras' estimated death toll after figures jumped drastically Nov. 2 the same day that news broke of a landslide in Nicaragua that covered two villages and killed up to 2000 people.    That day Honduras' official death toll jumped from 600 to 5000. Later authorities raised the figure to 6400 then last week to 7007.    Luis Torres spokesman for the committee overseeing the relief effort told The Associated Press that ``all the information is being verified by the mayors' offices the army the police public and private rescue groups and the authorities of the 18 provinces of the country.''    The revised figure from Honduras lowers the overall death toll in Central America from Hurricane Mitch to 9071.    Meanwhile Honduras' legislature restored its bill of rights which was suspended Nov. 2 when flooding from Mitch sparked looting and banditry and ended an 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. Lawmakers said the emergency had been overcome.    The government also reversed its explanation for a helicopter crash that killed the overwhelmingly popular mayor of the capital Cesar Castellanos a 50-year-old neurosurgeon who was considered the top candidate to become Honduras' next president.    Officials had blamed mechanical failure but said Tuesday that human error caused the crash which occurred while Castellanos was surveying hurricane damage.    ``Pilot Jose Miranda caused the tragedy when he made an unplanned maneuver which caused the craft the crash into high-tension cables and fall to the ground'' Judge Dagoberto Aspra said Tuesday.    He spoke after listening to audiotapes of communications between the pilot and the control tower.    Miranda was also killed in the crash.

<HTML>    TOKYO AP  The juries are in the votes have been cast and a Tokyo publisher has announced the 10 most popular new phrases to enter the Japanese language this year.    The Jiyu Kokuminsha Inc. unveiled the winners chosen every year by a long selection process involving juries made up of readers at an awards ceremony Tuesday night showcasing Japan's love of neologisms.    This year's top choice: ``the wizard of Yokohama'' the nickname for ace relief pitcher Kazuhiro Sasaki of the Yokohama Bay Stars professional baseball team.    ``I was embarrassed to be called wizard but from now on I'll hold my head up high'' Sasaki told those in attendance at the ceremony.    The No. 2 spot went to ``the nobody the soldier and the weirdo'' a phrase that captured public disgust for the three candidates for prime minister who vied for the top spot in a ruling party election last July.    The nobody referred to the eventual victor Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi an uninspiring public speaker who started his Cabinet with one of the lowest approval ratings in Japanese history  only to see it decline ever since.    Liberal Democratic lawmaker Seiroku Kajiyama earned the moniker the soldier for sitting at attention through television debates and spouting conservative opinions a spokeswoman for the event said.    The weirdo  Junichiro Koizumi  attracted attention more for his outlandish unkempt hair than any compelling vision for his country's future.    Rounding out the top three was ``I told ya so!''  a phrase made popular among school girls by the Pirates a female pop duo.    The phrases were chosen by 5000 juries made up of readers of Jiyu Kokuminsha's most popular book Elementary Knowledge of Modern Language a dictionary published yearly of new words and phrases.    A committee compiled the winners from the juries' votes.  UR; mef

<HTML>    BRUSSELS Belgium AP  North Korea still suffering from a devastating famine held its first talks with the European Union on Wednesday discussing human rights food aid and security on the Korean peninsula.    The aim of the meeting is to see if Europeans can have a regular political dialogue with North Korea one of the last hard-line communist nations.    ``We are quite pleased North Korea has agreed to debate a broad agenda of issues'' EU spokesman Nigel Gardner said Tuesday.    The EU side will include mid-level officials from Austria Britain and Germany and Percy Westerlund a Swede who is director general at the European Commission's foreign affairs office.    Gardner would not speculate on why North Korea had agreed to talks here and could not give a list of North Korean participants.    However North Korea has reached out to other nations due to an ongoing famine has forced residents of remote areas to subsist on leaves and twigs according to visitors to the hermetic nation.    Gardner also said the EU-North Korea talks will touch on efforts by Japan South Korea the United States and the EU to build two nuclear reactors for North Korea which was suspected of developing atomic weapons under the guise of nuclear power programs.    The three nations and the EU formed a consortium in 1994 known as the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization that recently approved a new dlrs 4.6 billion estimate for the two reactors.    KEDO was created after North Korea agreed to freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear weapons program in exchange for two light-water nuclear power plants and 500000-ton annual fuel oil shipments until they are completed.    The reactors are to be ready for use by 2003 and will replace North Korea's Soviet-developed graphite-moderated reactors that produce greater amounts of weapons-grade plutonium.

<HTML>    HONG KONG AP  Most Asian stock markets were sharply lower Tuesday following Wall Street's decline with Hong Kong prices diving for the third straight day.    Hong Kong's blue chip Hang Seng Index plummeted 4.1 percent as the market digested a host of negative economic data as well as Monday's 2.3 percent fall by the Dow Jones industrial average in New York.    The Hang Seng closed below the psychologically important level of 10000 points to end at 9975.85 down 426.47 points.    Traders are worried about Hong Kong's economy which is struggling through recession said Michael Ng dealing director at Sassoon Securities.    Hong Kong's gross domestic product fell by 7 percent in the third quarter prompting the government to lower its economic forecast a 5 percent contraction for 1998. Since that gloomy news was announced Friday the market has shed 7.1 percent.    Late Monday the government reported its budget deficit for the first seven months of the fiscal year had reached 50.16 billion Hong Kong dollar U.S. dlrs 6.43 billion well above the 21 billion Hong Kong dollar dlrs 2.69 billion deficit the government estimated for the fiscal year that ends March 31.    Market participants also said the Hang Seng index's plunge was a natural correction as investors cashed in after sharp gains over the past two months.    In Tokyo the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell 48.29 points or 0.3 percent to 14835.41 after a 185.69-point fall Monday.    Traders said the market reacted mildly to Wall Street's drop and news that JDC a financially troubled contractor had filed for legal protection from creditors.    ``Despite JDC's failure and the overnight drop in New York the market showed some resilience'' said Sachio Ishikawa general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.    Singapore share prices were sharply lower before the close with the benchmark Straits Times Index down 43.82 points or 3.1 percent at 1372.73.    Other Asian markets were also lower.

<HTML>    FRANKFURT Germany AP  Europe's top central banker Tuesday called on Europeans to have faith in their future saying a lack of confidence was a major risk to the economy ahead of the Jan. 1 launch of the euro common currency.    Wim Duisenberg president of the European Central Bank said sagging growth and a year of market volatility had already shaken corporate confidence in Europe. And his plea for support appeared to reflect analysts' concerns that the euro is being launched at a difficult time.    Growth in Europe is falling. Coupled with the danger of falling prices  or deflation  the scenario could result in recession though that danger is far off.    The European Central Bank will set monetary policy for the 11 euro nations as soon as the currency is launched. With some euro nations pushing for lower interest rates to help curb unemployment the bank may have a tough job ahead.    Growth may achieve just 2.5 percent in in 1999 compared to earlier expectations of 3 percent Duisenberg said. And despite ``calmer conditions'' on world financial markets in November he called for caution saying the economy could still worsen.    The central bank must ``be at the helm right from the beginning. There will be no mercy'' from financial markets worried about falling growth and the potential for deflation said Adolf Rosenstock economist at Nomura.    The bank is being watched most keenly for how it will determine a common interest rate for the so-called ``euro zone.'' Duisenberg acknowledged that the interest rate discussion was ``intensifying and deepening and livening up'' but  as widely expected  did not reveal the rate.    Many analysts expect it to be at or around Germany's 3.3 percent though some think the bank will set it at 3 percent to boost growth in Europe.    Duisenberg also touched on the ECB's independence from politicians  the most sensitive issue facing the bank and one that stems from the interest rate debate.    Germany repeatedly has urged the bank to drop interest rates to boost economies and help governments cut unemployment standing Europe-wide at 9.9 percent. The ECB says its job is to keep prices steady and inflation low not to tinker with monetary policy to achieve broader economic goals.    Pressure only grew Tuesday as leaders of Germany and France agreed to strengthen efforts to fight unemployment and boost the economy.    While Duisenberg said the bank wanted governments to reform labor markets to increase employment and boost growth he said it was prepared to cooperate in other ways. He did not give specifics.    ``Without prejudice to price stability our policy should and will contribute to the other economic goals'' he said.    Duisenberg chided governments for not doing enough to produce budget surpluses and reduce debt levels which he said ``are still at a very high level.''    ``These are risks endangering the credibility of the euro and the objective of price stability'' in the future euro area Duisenberg said.    With the Jan. 1 euro launch imminent analysts have said the ECB is under increasing pressure to spell out its policies. Duisenberg who spoke after a meeting of the ECB's governing council announced the bank would aim to keep money supply growth in the economy at 4.5 percent roughly meeting expectations.

<HTML>    JERUSALEM AP  Contractors bidding on a Jewish housing project in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem visited the site Tuesday and police detained three protesters from the Peace Now group trying to disrupt the tour.    Peace Now leader Mossi Raz struggled and yelled as police carried him into a police van. Police and soldiers also scuffled with several other Peace Now activists as they tried to approach the construction site.    The Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa consisting of 6500 apartments is being built in east Jerusalem on land Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.    The Palestinians hope to establish a future capital in east Jerusalem. They say Har Homa is part of an Israeli plan to cut off the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem from their hinterland in Bethlehem and the southern West Bank.    White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart has called the project ``inconsistent with the spirit'' of last month's Wye River peace agreement.    On Tuesday several Israeli builders interested in being awarded contracts at Har Homa toured the site in a convoy of cars.    Fifteen Peace Now activists protesting against the construction plans were barred by police from entering the site.    Five members of the outlawed anti-Arab Kach group demonstrated next to Peace Now chanting ``Peace Now a knife in the back.''    Israel maintains that Jerusalem must remain under exclusive Israeli sovereignty. Prime Minister Netanyahu has promised that the first homes in Har Homa would be completed in 2000.    Ground-breaking for Har Homa known in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim led to Palestinian rioting last year and a 19-month stalemate in the peace negotiations.    Also on Tuesday The Jerusalem Post newspaper reported that the Israeli government has approved the construction of 480 additional homes in the Jewish settlement of Kohav Yaacov in the West Bank.    Housing Ministry spokesman Moshe Friedman however said that no such decision had been made. Friedman said that the construction of 230 apartments in the settlement has been under way for a year and that the ground breaking for the other 250 apartments will begin in the next few days.

<HTML>    BANGKOK Thailand AP  Inauguration of the main media center for the 13th Asian Games was postponed Tuesday because the facilities weren't ready the latest blow to the hopes of host country Thailand that everything will run smoothly.    Five days before Asia's biggest sporting competition officially opens bugs are turning up  literally  in a last-minute frenzy to put the finishing touches on venues and in some cases make them usable.    The Bangkok Post highlighted problems both about the poor soccer pitch at the National Stadium where the main matches will be played and the central swimming pool's tendency to fill up with dead insects.    Taiwan's riding team at the equestrian center meanwhile blamed poor arena conditions for injuries to a prize horse. And a surprise rainstorm threatened to soak Tuesday's final rehearsal for the opening ceremonies.    Nearly 5000 journalists have been accredited to cover the games which will bring together some 6000 athletes from 41 countries in what the organizers have billed as the 20th century's last great sporting event.    But the organization and construction of the venues has been plagued by the Asian economic crisis.    The main media center already a week behind schedule for its inauguration saw the official opening postponed again Tuesday when Jurin Laksanavisit a government minister didn't show because the facilities weren't ready.    ``I'm still trying to get the center officially opened today'' said Santiparb Tejavanija deputy secretary general of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee. ``It's already behind schedule. Now they want to postpone until Dec. 3. That will be too late.''    The pitch at the Bangkok's National Stadium where Oman demolished Hong Kong 6-0 in Monday's preliminary soccer matches which unofficially kicked off the competition is far below the required international standard the Bangkok Post cited Asia's top soccer official as saying.    Dato Peter Velappan secretary general of the Asian Football Confederation said that the pitch needed to be upgraded immediately or another ground would have to be found for remaining matches.    Velappan said he had warned Thailand six months ago that the pitch was not good enough. Attempts to improve it made matters worse because the contractor who laid new turf had more experience with home gardens than soccer grounds the Post said.    Just days ago parts of the pitch were covered in water and bare patches were showing.    Meanwhile the head of the Swimming Association of Thailand was quoted in the same newspaper as saying that thousands of dead insects of all kinds have been found floating in the central competition pool.    ``For Thai men it might not be a serious problem but I am sure it would make the foreigners' hair stand on end'' Maj. Gen. Kamol Saen-issara said.    Games officials with the help of the Public Health Department have tried to solve the problem to no avail. Kamol said organizers might have to turn to strong insecticides but vowed not to use any substances that could harm swimmers.    Kamol said he hoped that when the pool is in use the increased presence of humans might keep the bugs away. But since they tend to come at night attracted from swampy nearby fields to the bright lights more help might be needed.

<HTML>    JERUSALEM AP  Archaeology one of Israel's biggest tourist attractions suffered a blow Tuesday when most of its excavations were shut down.    The Israel Antiquities Authority halted its salvage digs  carried out ahead of most construction projects  after the Supreme Court ruled that developers and builders cannot be billed for these excavations.    In the country of Jesus and King Solomon Richard the Lion Hearted and Saladin the Arab conqueror who battled the crusaders in the streets of Jerusalem it is almost impossible to start a building or a road without uncovering ancient remains.    In response to a petition from a developer however the Supreme Court ruled Sunday that the government not the builder must bear the costs of the salvage digs operated by the Antiquities Authority.    In response the Antiquities Authority decided Tuesday to halt all salvage digs which account for about 300 of the 350 excavations carried out in Israel each year.    ``We have no budget for salvage digs'' said Antiquities Authority spokeswoman Osnat Gouez.    Major digs open to the public like those in Jerusalem Caesarea and Beit Shean have been drastically curtailed for lack of government funding Gouez said.    In the archaeological sense Israel is the one of the most crowded countries in the world with some 25000 known sites excavated or waiting to be dug up.

<HTML>    KABUL Afghanistan AP  Tightly wrapped against the cold that seeps through the damp walls of Kabul's children's hospital 4-month-old Aminullah struggles to survive.    Doctors say the malnourished boy who is barely the size of a newborn has little chance of making it through the frigid Afghan winter when temperatures sink well below freezing.    The winter will be much harder this year after international aid groups pulled out of the capital city rather than follow rules imposed by the Taliban religious army.    ``I don't know what to do. ... He is so hungry'' says Aminullah's mother Huzra as she rocks him gently back and forth at the Indira Gandhi Hospital a multi-story cement building where the wind whistles through the cold hallways.    The hospital has few supplies. The pharmacy is bare. The only ambulance has been locked away on the compound of one of the many aid groups that left the city earlier this year.    After two decades of war in Afghanistan Kabul is a desperate city. Entire neighborhoods lie in ruin. Food stalls in the market are often full but too expensive for the poorest.    The glucose drip attached to Aminullah's hand was bought in the market and the dirty woolen blanket Huzra pulls tightly around her shoulders was brought from her home in the ruins of Kabul.    In front of the Ministry of Public Health workers load about a dozen pieces of firewood onto a battered steel food trolley and push it a little over a mile two kilometers to the children's hospital.    ``Every day the children are complaining that they are cold ... but we have no fuel no wood nothing'' says hospital administrator Maulvi Hajji Nasruddin. ``We have no way to get anything. ... We have only God.''    In July dozens of aid groups pulled out of Kabul to protest a Taliban order forcing them to relocate to abandon school dormitories.    Negotiations are currently underway for some to return. At least 15 groups are expected to come back in the coming months still a significant drop from the more than 40 that once worked in the capital.    The United Nations is waiting for security guarantees and a promise of cooperation from the Taliban before allowing its international staff to return. The United Nations has complained of interference since the religious army took Kabul in September 1996.    The group controls 90 percent of the country where it has imposed its strict version of Islamic law.    The international Red Cross and the United Nations estimate that more than 500000 people in Kabul  or two-thirds of the city  depend on international aid to survive.    One vital service that continued despite the aid groups' pullout was a program of bakeries throughout the capital that provides subsidized bread to the poorest.    For some the bakeries run by the World Food Program the Red Cross and CARE International supply their only food other than heavily sugared tea.    ``In winter there is a great need. ... This year it will be worse because assistance is limited. The international agencies are not here to help'' said Zia Nasir field officer for the World Food Program in Kabul.    For women like Raeza whose husband was killed when a rocket smashed into their home the bread is all that is saving her and her seven children from ruin. For dinner most nights she serves bread and hot water.    ``Sometimes I beg. ... Some families know I am poor and they bring their old clothes to me'' says Raeza who like many Afghans uses only one name her barefoot daughter clinging to her blackened skirt.    In the ruins of Kabul Lailama Afghani clutches her feverish baby in her arms and slumps to the cold ground frightened at the prospect of another winter.    Her husband is sick. Her home is a bombed-out hovel in the middle of a rocket-ruined neighborhood a victim of the bitter factional fighting that followed the end of communist rule here in 1992.    Against the bitterly cold nights she has only one wool blanket for warmth.    ``Feel my baby. He has a fever but I have no medicine no money. What can I do?'' she asks the burqa she is forced to wear slung over her head to expose her face.    At an orphanage where 350 children live in an unheated building there is no money for blankets or warm clothing. Some of the smallest children have no shoes. The Red Cross had agreed to supply the orphanage with wood. The impoverished Taliban government has nothing to offer.    ``This will be the worst winter. ... We have no economy. This government is like a sick person in the desert'' said orphanage director Maulvi Mohammed Asif.

<HTML>    LAGOS Nigeria AP  A special military commando force established to fight violent crime in Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos has been pulled off the city streets following the shooting deaths of three men last month.    Commandos shot and killed three men in Lagos claiming they were armed robbers. The killings however have triggered an outcry against the heavily armed task force.    Lagos military administrator Col. Buba Marwa was quoted Tuesday on state radio as saying the move to withdraw the anti-crime force was in response to public opinion.    Lagos and much of Nigeria is notorious for violent crime including kidnappings armed robbery and murder.    The military's anti-crime commando force won accolades initially for reducing the crime rate particularly the number of armed robberies. But a recent string of shooting deaths blamed on the commando force has soured public opinion.    Nigeria's military which has ruled this West African country for much of the time since independence in 1960 is often viewed with suspicion.    The current military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has been working to put a kinder face on the army's public image and has promised to return power to civilians next year.    str/ids/tjs

<HTML>    TOKYO AP  The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Tuesday in Tokyo following an overnight decline on Wall Street. Japanese stocks finished the day's trading lower.    The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 48.29 points or 0.32 percent closing the day's trading at 14835.41 points. On Monday the Nikkei closed down 185.69 points or 1.23 percent.    In mid-afternoon trading the U.S. dollar bought 122.88 yen down 0.94 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 123.26 yen overnight.    The dollar's weakness was largely because of the overnight fall in U.S. stocks traders said. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9116.55 on Monday down 216.53 points or 2.3 percent.    ``The margin of fall in the Dow was quite big. That has muted the bullish sentiment over the U.S. economy and the dollar somewhat'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto senior manager of the treasury and funding department of Sanwa Bank.    Among those selling the dollar were U.S. hedge funds and Japanese institutional investors traders said.    On the Tokyo Stock Exchange market sentiments remained bearish because of the fall on Wall Street as well as local news reports that Tokyo-based JDC Corp. a medium-sized general contractor was seeking court protection from creditors.    JDC later confirmed that it filed for protection with the Tokyo District Court Tuesday morning with debts totaling 406.7 billion yen dlrs 3.33 billion from failed golf course and other projects.    It was the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese general contractor since Tokai Kogyo Co. went under last year after amassing debts of 511 billion yen dlrs 4.18 billion according to Teikoku Data Bank a Tokyo think tank.    The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first section was down 1.24 points or 0.11 percent to 1142.26 points. The TOPIX closed down 14.85 points or 1.28 percent the day before.    The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.140 percent from Monday's finish of 1.040 percent driving its price down to 105.68 yen from 106.59 yen.  UR; may-dj-km

<HTML>    KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia AP  A key police witness in the Anwar Ibrahim trial told the court Tuesday that he had failed to win business favors from the ex-deputy prime minister but denied that led him to testify against the defendant.    The former police intelligence officer Amir Junos faced questioning from defense attorneys about whether he was biased against Anwar because his request for favors had been denied.    Earlier the witness had admitted during cross-examination that he had asked Anwar for equity in a securities firm and business deals for his friends.    ``I was not given anything. I merely tried to express my feeling to get a portion of the equity but I did not get anything'' Amir told the court.    Defense lawyer Christopher Fernando suggested Amir might bear a grudge after having failed to get the equity stake in the brokerage.    ``I do not have such intentions'' Amir replied.    Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 two weeks after he was fired as deputy prime minister and finance minister.    His subsequent jailing and beating while in custody has attracted international concern over the case including governments from the 15-member European Union.    ``The EU is concerned that the Malaysian authorities have still not published the results of the investigations on the beating and urges them to do so as soon as possible'' the European Union said in a statement made available Tuesday.    Anwar is being tried on four counts of corruption. He will be tried on another corruption count as well as five counts of sexual misconduct at a later date.    Anwar who was also finance minister denies the charges calling them part of political vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.    Amir was called as a witness by the prosecution to prove allegations that Anwar had directed the police to obtain retractions from two people who accused Anwar of having sex with his secretary's wife and sodomizing his chauffeur.    On Tuesday Amir conceded under cross-examination that it was wrong for police to have used scare tactics to obtain retractions from Ummi Hafilda Ali and Azizan Abu Bakar.    ``What Anwar asked you to do was it wrong or improper?'' asked defense attorney Gurbachan Singh.    ``I think it is wrong'' Amir said.    ``Are you then admitting that what you did was wrong and improper?'' Gurbachan pressed on.    After a long pause Amir quietly said: ``It was wrong. What I did was wrong.''    Amir also acknowledged that Anwar didn't order police to obtain retractions from Ummi and Azizan using the ``turning over'' operation a method of interrogation that includes sleep deprivation and physical threats.    However he maintained that Anwar abused his power as deputy prime minister coercing police officers to carry out his desires without issuing specific orders.    The trial now in its fourth week has been buffeted by chaos including the sentencing on Monday of a defense lawyer to a three-month jail sentence for contempt of court.    Judge Augustine Paul handed down the sentence Monday after Zainur Zakaria refused to apologize for an affidavit he had filed on behalf of Anwar seeking the removal of two prosecutors on grounds that they were fabricating evidence.    The lawyer who won a reprieve from a higher court until his appeal hearing Friday was present in the court Tuesday.    Amir the chief witness on Tuesday also denied warning Anwar about ``political enemies'' or telling the former No. 2 that his phone had been tapped since 1992.    Defense lawyer Fernando asked Amir if he had warned Anwar that trade minister Rafidah Aziz and former chief minister of Malacca state Abdul Rahim Thamby Chik were his enemies because he had recommended that they face corruption charges.    ``I disagree that I had identified by name several of Anwar's enemies'' Amir said.

<HTML>    NAIROBI Kenya AP  Sudanese rebels said Tuesday they fought off a four-pronged government attack in the Nuba Mountains in western central Sudan.    Government ground forces attacked the region on Nov. 11 and were finally driven out on Nov. 23 said Martin Okerruk spokesman for the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army in Nairobi.    Sudanese opposition radio said SPLA troops killed 42 government soldiers wounded many others and took four prisoners. Two rebel soldiers were killed and eight wounded it said.    Okerruk said he could not confirm the casualty figures because he was still waiting for details from the field.    Animist and Christian rebels in southern Sudan have fought a 15-year insurgency for autonomy from the Arab Muslim-dominated government in the north. More than 1.5 million Sudanese have died in the fighting and consequent famines.    kjd

<HTML>    LONDON AP  Myanmar has barred British ministers and officials from the country following British pressure on the military regime to hold talks with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.    The Foreign Office announced Tuesday that the military regime in Rangoon said no minister or officials will receive a visa to enter the country also known as Burma.    Last month Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett called for a European Union mission including Britain to visit Myanmar in an attempt to improve human rights in the country which has been under military rule since 1962.    Britain also discourages companies from putting new investment into Myanmar.    ``I regret this move by the Burmese regime'' Fatchett said Tuesday. ``It will in no way dissuade us from continuing to work for an improvement in the human rights and the political situation in Burma and bringing pressure on the regime to enter into dialogue with democratic leaders.''    Suu Kyi winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize has been locked in a battle of wills with the ruling council of generals over demands that a parliament elected in 1990 be convened. Her National League for Democracy won the elections but the military never allowed Parliament to meet.    The EU has already placed sanctions on the Myanmar regime including an arms embargo putting restrictions on visas and suspending non-humanitarian aid.    ``The visa ban is an acknowledgment that the U.K. is at the forefront of international action to bring pressure on the Burmese regime to improve the human rights and political situation in Burma'' a Foreign Office spokesman said anonymously in keeping with British practice.    acw-er

<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  President Boris Yeltsin is feeling better but is still spending part of the day in a hospital bed as he continues to be treated for pneumonia officials said Tuesday.    A Kremlin spokesman said the president was doing limited paperwork and there were no plans for any meetings or visitors. He did not say how much longer Yeltsin would remain in the government hospital where he has been for 10 days.    Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev said Tuesday that the president is expected to return to work at the Kremlin ``in the nearest time.''    ``Doctors are having trouble keeping the president in the hospital'' Sysuyev said at a news conference.    The 67-year-old leader is known as a restless patient who sometimes ignores the advice of his doctors.    Dr. Renat Akchurin who conducted Yeltsin's heart bypass surgery two years ago said the president's repeated illnesses may be due to a weakened immune system.    Akchurin said that he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months but said heart problems appeared unlikely according to an interview with the weekly Argumenty i Fakty cited by the Interfax news agency. He also dismissed speculation that Yeltsin's heart surgery had affected his brain.    Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin insisted that the president had no problems remembering anything and was always alert.    Yeltsin ``is unhappy about being sick he is not submitting to his illness'' Yakushkin said in an interview with the weekly Sobesednik also cited by Interfax.    ``It's interesting though not always easy to talk to the president'' Yakushkin said calling Yeltsin ``quite an emotional person.''    Yeltsin met his chief-of-staff Valentin Yumashev in the hospital Monday and was briefed on government and national affairs.    On Tuesday the president spoke by telephone with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to discuss the agenda of the premier's talks with International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus who arrived in Moscow later on Tuesday.    Russian television showed brief footage of Yeltsin dressed in a white shirt and dark cardigan and looking pale listening intently to his aide and nodding periodically. Like most footage of Yeltsin released in recent weeks Monday's tape didn't contain any sound of the president speaking.    Yeltsin's repeated illnesses and his infrequent public appearances have raised concerns about his ability to lead the country  now mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse  through the end of his term in mid-2000.    Sysuyev reiterated Tuesday that Yeltsin will concentrate on political matters leaving day-to-day management of economic matters to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. ``You shouldn't think that the president and his office aren't taking part and controlling the economic developments such as preparing next year's budget and tax reform'' he said.    Yeltsin has remained out of public view throughout the latest economic crisis that hit in mid-August further eroding his sagging popularity.    ``It's known that the president now doesn't have sufficiently high popularity to put it mildly'' Sysuyev said according to the Interfax news agency. He insisted however that the president continues to play a stabilizing role in Russian society blunting antagonism between different political forces.    adc

<HTML>    NEW DELHI India AP  Recent provincial election results have inspired new hope among members of the 112-year-old Congress party and trumpeted the arrival of Sonia Gandhi on India's political landscape party officials and analysts said.    After years of waning influence and dwindling votes India's main opposition party pulverized the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in crucial provincial elections in three states last week.    The BJP lost power in New Delhi state where the federal capital is located and the western desert state of Rajasthan  two longtime BJP strongholds  and retained power in the central Madhya Pradesh state despite projections of a BJP victory.    Congress leaders said it was a clear victory for Sonia Gandhi the Italian-born widow of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi who is seen by her admirers as India's prime minister-in-waiting.    ``She has certainly made a good start considering the doubts there were earlier'' said B. G. Verghese of New Delhi's independent Center for Policy Research. ``She has matured she is a much more confident leader ... with greater acceptability within the party and greater credibility outside.''    Though the state balloting had no direct effect on the BJP's hold on federal power the results will weaken its standing  and its hold over its 19 coalition partners. Gandhi though has said she would not make an immediate bid for power by pressing for a parliamentary confidence vote.    Gandhi who married into what was once India's most powerful political family is the first non-Indian since independence 50 years ago to lead the Congress. The party was founded in 1885 by a British man.    Between her late husband his mother Indira Gandhi and her father Jawaharlal Nehru the dynasty led India for nearly four decades of its 50 years since independence.    The BJP had shrugged off the influence of the 51-year-old Sonia Gandhi when she stepped into politics early this year dismissing her as a ``foreigner.'' Sonia Gandhi is now an Indian citizen.    ``It's wrong to say she is formidable'' said K.R. Malkani a BJP vice-president told The Associated Press. He said the BJP lost because of its own weaknesses not Congress's strengths.    ``The way the government failed to control prices the way infighting went on in the party  I think that's more responsible for the defeat'' he said.    Thousands of voters heard Sonia Gandhi campaign last month and during the federal election earlier this year. She slowly read speeches in Hindi India's national language written in Roman script.    She wears a traditional Indian sari draping the end over the head as tradition-minded women do to show respect for their elders.    During the campaign she targeted rises in the price of several food grains and vegetables and the BJP's attempt to inject its Hindu nationalist thought into the country's education system.

<HTML>    LAGOS Nigeria AP  Shell Oil has shut down sections of a key crude oil pipeline in southern Nigeria after workers trying to seal a leak were attacked by stone-throwing villagers company officials said Tuesday.    Officials believe the leak was the result of sabotage.    Five flow stations have been closed between oil wells and an export terminal in the coastal town of Bonny in the oil-rich southwestern Niger River delta a company spokesman said on condition of anonymity.    The leak was discovered on Friday and several efforts to seal it were thwarted by village youths who attacked Shell technicians with rocks the spokesman said. It was not revealed where the leak occurred or how it was caused although Shell says it believes it was the result of sabotage.    The shutdown cuts Shell's crude oil output in Nigeria  the world's sixth largest oil producer  by about 145000 barrels a day.    Nigeria suffers hundreds of offshore and underground pipeline spills every year.    Many are the result of sabotage by villagers who demand that the government or companies pay monetary compensation for the resulting environmental damage. Others are caused by scavengers who collect the spilled oil to use and resell.    In October an explosion and fire killed at least 700 people in the southern town of Jesse where poor residents were collecting gasoline spilling from a government-owned pipeline.    Government officials said they believe scavengers' tools set off the blast.    Some spills allegedly occur due to the neglect of international oil companies and the Nigerian government which owns many pipelines.    Village youths disrupted Shell's production in the Niger delta for several weeks in August during a campaign to protest lack of essential services provided by the military government which receives oil revenue from multinational companies.    A U.N. human rights envoy on Monday reportedly called for an independent inquiry into claims that international oil companies have caused widespread environmental damage in Nigeria. There has been no reaction by the government or oil companies to the call.    fa-gam/ids

<HTML>    PORT MORESBY Papua New Guinea AP  Electrical workers have imposed power blackouts across the country for the second day in a row as a national strike by trade unions to protest the government's 1999 budget continues.    The strike which was called by trade union members last Friday in defiance of Papua New Guinea Trade Union Congress leaders began with only intermittent industrial action but appears to be gathering momentum.    About 1300 workers employed by Papua New Guinea's main power supplier Elcom have cut power to all residences and businesses throughout the country from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.    Elcom National Staff Association general secretary Philip Kaira said the blackouts may be reviewed and the power unions may change their strategy.    ``Now we may just focus on government bodies who have a huge outstanding debts to Elcom'' Kaira said.    ``We may shift our strategy and hit cut off power to all those customers who owe large sums of money to Elcom in unpaid bills.''    Kaira said the unions may disconnect power supplies to government buildings and offices including Parliament House in Port Moresby.    The unions have called for Prime Minister Bill Skate's government to redraft its budget which slashes spending across most government departments axes 7000 public service jobs and abolishes key research institutions.    Skate has refused to redraft the budget and claims that the national strike is not based on industrial issues but is politically motivated and illegal.    pjs

Police in two cities descended on the homes of Xu Wenli Qin Yongmin and other members of the China Democracy Party on Monday night and took them away relatives and the rights group said.    The police action was one of the harshest since dissidents announced the formation of the would-be opposition group in June to challenge the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power. Since then police have questioned briefly detained and harassed the activists but refrained from filing charges.    Signaling the leadership's resolve to quash any challenges the party's No. 2 legislative chairman Li Peng was quoted Tuesday as saying that Western-style democracy was inappropriate for China and opposition groups would not be tolerated.    If organizations seek ``the multi-party system and try to negate the leadership of the Communist Party then they will not be allowed to exist'' Li told the German business daily Handelsblatt in an interview carried by China's official Xinhua News Agency.    Police on Tuesday informed the family of Qin Yongmin that he was arrested for plotting to overthrow the government the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. The crime carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.    In taking Xu Wenli from his home Monday night police produced an arrest warrant and a search warrant that identified him as a criminal suspect said his wife He Xitong. Unlike previous occasions when Xu was held only for short periods she feared this time authorities were planning to charge and convict him.    Twenty police officers ransacked their Beijing apartment seizing a computer a fax machine address books video tapes a typewriter more than 1000 pages of documents and even a telephone she said.    ``Xu Wenli has already paid heavily for democracy. I understand that he is ready to pay again'' said his wife. ``Xu Wenli won't give up.''    In Washington State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the United States views Xu's detention ''as a serious step in the wrong direction'' and added that U.S. officials have urged Chinese authorities to release Xu immediately.    ''We have said for some weeks now that we are disturbed by the recent number of detentions of dissidents that serve to limit political debate in China'' Rubin said.    He said Xu had been ''for peacefully exercising fundamental freedoms guaranteed by international human rights instruments.''    Rubin offered no information on Qin's detention.

<HTML>    BRUSSELS Belgium AP  France's oil giant Total SA took over Belgian petrochemicals company Petrofina SA to create the sixth largest oil company in the world and the third largest in Europe the companies announced Tuesday.    The new company will be known as Total Fina and the move was the latest in a series of mergers affecting the global oil market. The new company will be quoted on the Paris Brussels New York and London stock exchanges a Petrofina statement said.    Petrofina's stock stood at 14250 francs dlrs 407.9 Friday before it was suspended for Monday's trading. The deal put the value at 19.482 francs dlrs 557.7 a jump in value of over a quarter.

<HTML>    MILAN Italy AP  Internazionale on Tuesday signed Romanian Mircea Lucescu to replace Gigi Simoni as coach of the star-studded but volatile Milan team through the end of the Italian Serie A season in May.    Lucescu's hiring for a reported 1 billion lire dlrs 555000 was announced at Inter's training camp one day after the startling dismissal of Simoni.    The Italian veteran was fired despite consecutive victories which kept Inter in contention for the European Champions Cup and Italian league titles.    Club president Massimo Moratti bitterly criticized Inter's play following a 3-1 victory against defending champion Real Madrid in a European Champions League game last Wednesday and an injury-time 2-1 victory against lightly regarded Salernitana in a league match Sunday.    Inter whose roster includes Ronaldo Youri Djorkaeff Roberto Baggio Diego Simeone and Ivan Zamorano is in sixth place in the Italian league with a 5-2-4 record and 17 points five behind league-leading Fiorentina.    Lucescu a former Romanian national team coach and manager of several club sides including Dynamo Bucharest and Italy's Brescia and Reggiana was presented to the Italian media at Appiano Gentile Tuesday afternoon.    He then directed the first training session with Inter players for Sunday's league match against Vicenza.    ``I will need time to change the team ... to switch to zone defense and make the play more offensive'' Lucescu said.    ``I'm convinced I did the right thing'' Moratti said Tuesday. ``I think to have interpreted the feeling of our fans who were unhappy with the team play.''    Inter sold a record of 60000 season tickets this year after it won the UEFA Cup title and finished second to Juventus in the Italian league last season.    Simoni whose stay with Inter was stormy since the beginning of his two-year contract said Tuesday he was the victim of ``an unfair unexpected decision.''    Some Italian sports dailies suggested that Simoni paid for the bad start of Brazilian superstar Ronaldo who has been repeatedly sidelined with tendinitis in his knee and failed to provide the Milan team with the goals and play he produced last season.    Simoni also had been criticized frequently for his overly defensive tactics.    Lucescu 53 is expected by many to be an interim manager until Italian Marcello Lippi can take over.    Lippi is rumored to ben leaving league champion Juventus of Turin at the end of this season and could join Inter for the 1998-99 season. However Moratti denied a decision for next season has been make.    ``Lucescu can prove he deserves to coach a great team. He could be a more lasting solution'' Moratti said.

<HTML>    SAN JUAN Puerto Rico AP  Nearly 40 percent of Puerto Ricans say they want statehood but almost as many want to remain a commonwealth of the United States according to a newspaper poll.    According to the poll published Tuesday in The San Juan Star 39 percent of those surveyed said they would vote for statehood in a Dec. 13 referendum called by pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello.    Rossello hopes the vote will encourage the U.S. Congress to clear up the Caribbean island's ambiguous relationship with Washington as a U.S. commonwealth. Congress has suggested that anything less than a majority vote for statehood would not be enough to change Puerto Rico's status.    In the poll 16 percent of voters said they were undecided.    Two other options on the ballot  a U.S. commonwealth definition rejected by the commonwealth party and a ``free association'' of an independent Puerto Rico with treaty ties to Washington  received 3 percent and 7 percent respectively.    However 34 percent said they will vote for ``none of the above'' a protest position adopted by Puerto Rico's pro-commonwealth party while just 3 percent said they will vote for total independence the Star said.    Puerto Rico's opposition Popular Democratic Party has called on its supporters to vote for ``none of the above'' claiming that Rossello's pro-statehood administration imposed its own ballot definition of commonwealth  one that calls for fewer local powers for the Puerto Rican government and says that Congress has the right to revoke islanders' U.S. citizenship.    The door-to-door poll of 1049 registered voters was conducted Nov. 7-17 by Precision Research Inc. a private polling firm for The Star. Its margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.    Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens who cannot vote for president and have no vote in Congress. They do not pay federal taxes but receive limited federal benefits and they can be drafted into the military.    The Star said its poll suggests that Puerto Ricans may not send a clear enough message to Congress.    In March the U.S. House of Representatives narrowly approved a measure obliging Congress to act on a series of binding Puerto Rican status votes. The measure died in the U.S. Senate.    In a non-binding 1993 vote commonwealth edged out statehood by 48.6 percent to 46.3 percent. Just over 4 percent voted for independence.

<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  President Boris Yeltsin is feeling better but is still spending part of the day in a hospital bed as he continues to be treated for pneumonia officials said Tuesday.    A Kremlin spokesman said the president was doing limited paperwork and there were no plans for any meetings or visitors. He did not say how much longer Yeltsin would remain in the government hospital where he has been for 10 days.    Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev said on Tuesday that the president is expected to return to work at the Kremlin ``in the nearest time.'' ``Doctors are having trouble keeping the president in the hospital'' Sysuyev said at a news conference.    The 67-year-old leader is known as a restless patient who sometimes ignores the advice of his doctors.    Yeltsin met his chief-of-staff Valentin Yumashev in the hospital Monday and was briefed on government and national affairs.    Russian television showed brief footage of Yeltsin dressed in a white shirt and dark cardigan and looking pale listening intently to his aide and nodding periodically. Like most footage of Yeltsin released in recent weeks Monday's tape didn't contain any sound of the president speaking.    Yeltsin's repeated illnesses and his infrequent public appearances have raised concerns about his ability to lead the country  now mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse  through the end of his term in mid-2000.    Sysuyev reiterated on Tuesday that Yeltsin will concentrate on political matters leaving day-to-day management of economic matters to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. ``You shouldn't think that the president and his office aren't taking part and controlling the economic developments such as preparing next year's budget and tax reform'' he said.    Yeltsin has remained out of public view throughout the latest economic crisis that hit in mid-August further eroding his sagging popularity.    ``It's known that the president now doesn't have sufficiently high popularity to put it mildly'' Sysuyev said according to the Interfax news agency. He insisted however that the president continues to play a stabilizing role in Russian society blunting antagonism between different political forces.    pvs/vi/ren

<HTML>    TEGUCIGALPA Honduras AP  Honduras announced Tuesday that it suspended a governor for inflating her region's death toll from Hurricane Mitch and lowered its official death count by 1350 people.    The new death toll of 5657 was compiled after the government sent teams to verify reports from regions across Honduras the Interior Secretariat said Tuesday.    The governor Lucila Esperanza Barahona de Castro of the Santa Barbara region in remote northwestern Honduras was suspended after investigators could verify only 282 of the 1159 deaths reported in her area.    Authorities said the suspension was standard procedure during an inquiry.    Barahona told The Associated Press she couldn't have falsified the numbers because she didn't even give a death toll to the federal government.    ``I don't know what source gave them the numbers'' she said Tuesday.    In addition to the 5657 dead Honduras said it had verified 8058 missing 12272 injured and 1.4 million homeless throughout the country.

<HTML>    TOKYO AP  A medium-sized Japanese general contractor went bankrupt Tuesday with debts totaling 406.7 billion yen dlrs 3.3 billion from failed golf course and other projects.    JDC Corp. filed for protection with the Tokyo District Court Tuesday morning company spokeswoman Yumiko Fukahori said.    It was the largest bankruptcy of a Japanese general contractor since Tokai Kogyo Co. went bust in July last year after amassing debts of 511 billion yen dlrs 4.2 billion according to Teikoku Data Bank a Tokyo think tank.    Trading in JDC shares listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section was suspended Tuesday following Japanese news reports on the company's troubles the exchange said.    JDC said its finances deteriorated when Japan's real-estate business took a downturn in the early 1990s.    Founded in 1951 originally as a machinery leasing firm the Tokyo-based company heavily invested in golf courses and other development projects from the 1980s.    The company posted 294.2 billion yen dlrs 2.41 billion in sales in the latest fiscal year ending in March down 7.2 percent from a year before. It employs 1725 workers.     UR;     TOKYO AP  Prosecutors arrested the chairman of Fuji Heavy Industries on Tuesday on suspicion of bribing a legislator for help in obtaining a defense contract Japanese media reports said.    Fuji Heavy Chairman Isamu Kawai 70 was arrested after prosecutors raided the company's headquarters to search for evidence Kyodo News reported.    Kawai and other top executives allegedly asked Yojiro Nakajima who has been arrested on separate charges for help in obtaining a contract to develop an amphibious airplane for Japan's Marine Self-Defense Forces.    The executives are suspected of bribing Nakajima while he was a vice defense minister.    Prosecutors and company officials would not confirm the arrest.    Last week prosecutors arrested Yasuyuki Kogure 64 a former Fuji Heavy executive director on charges of giving 5 million yen dlrs 41000 in kickbacks to Nakajima.    Nakajima 39 a Liberal Democratic Party member of Parliament was arrested last month on charges of ordering false receipts made to account for missing party money. The arrest was unrelated to the Fuji Heavy Industries case.    Fuji Heavy Industries maker of Subaru automobiles has said it donated 4 million yen dlrs 33000 to Nakajima since 1993 and bought 740000 yen dlrs 6115 worth of tickets for fund-raising parties for the lawmaker.

AAPT's largest shareholder AAP Information Services was seen behind the sale. Its chief executive Lee Casey had no comment.     UR;     JAKARTA Indonesia AP  Political unreast and a rising crime rate have worsened a retail slump in Indonesia according to the Indonesian Retailers' Association.    The increasingly uncertain situation on Jakarta's streets has resulted in many people leaving work earlier and reduced the likelihood of night shopping once a favorite pastime among affluent Jakarta residents.    ``I think some of the retailers also feel very much that their volumes will go down'' association chairman Steve Sondakh told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview released Tuesday.    ``They are naturally going to shorten their operating hours'' said Sondahk who is also a direct of the Hero supermarket chain one of Indonesia's biggest retail groups.    Consumer activity has already been hit by a deep recession caused by Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years.    Sondakh said retail sales on average have already fallen between 30 percent and 40 percent from a year ago with the electronics sector being the hardest hit. Sales there are down an estimated 60 percent.    Lawlessness has been on the rise since political unrest that forced the outster of President Suharto earlier this year. Crime has gotten so bad in Jakarta that several foreign embassies are advising their citizens to avoid the city of 11 million altogether.     UR;     MANILA Philippines AP  Stable food prices and a return to moderate weather are expected to have slightly eased inflationary pressures in the Philippines in November analysts said Tuesday.    Economists said they expect inflation in November to register 10.1 percent year-on-year down from 10.2 percent in October. The data is due for release either Friday or Monday.    In the nine months to October inflation averaged 9.5 percent lower than the government's 10 percent target for 1998 and within most economists' projection of a single-digit average for the year.    Inflation hit double-digits in May for the first time in two years reaching 10.1 percent.    Food prices which account for 55 percent of the consumer price index had been boosted by weather disturbances throughout the year. A drought attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon caused food prices to peak in June and July.    The onset of rains in September improved agricultural production but a series of typhoons in October placed pressure on the food supply resulting still higher prices.    With the absence of heavy rains in November and the government's continued importation of basic necessities such as unmilled rice sugar and corn consumer prices are expected to have inched lower.

<HTML>    KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia AP  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday dared his detractors to form a political party and challenge him in a general election.    ``If they want to set up a political party its okay if they dare'' Mahathir told local reporters.    The Malaysian leader said authorities would approve the formation of a new political party if it eschewed street protests and promised not to hold demonstrations.    ``But if they say they want to form a political party because they want to shoot and kill people and hold demonstrations every day we will not give the approval'' Bernama news agency quoted him as saying after he inaugurated a new Malaysia-made small aircraft.    Supporters of jailed former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim have gathered repeatedly in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur in recent weeks to hold mostly peaceful anti-government demonstrations.    Anwar's supporters have shouted slogans demanding an end to Mahathir's 17-year rule and burned portraits of the prime minister.    Police in the Southeast Asian country have responded by using water cannons to disperse the crowds and arresting hundreds of anti-government activists.    Mahathir suggested that Anwar's supporters form an electoral party rather than organize protests that disrupt traffic and local commerce.    But a general election is not scheduled until 2000.    ``In the election they can contest they can also curse ...I am used to being cursed by them so it does not make much of a difference to me'' he said.    Mahathir fired his Anwar his former protege on Sept. 2 alleging that he was too immoral to rule. Anwar was subsequently arrested and is facing trial on 10 counts of abuse of office and illegal sex.    He has denied all the charges against him saying they were politically motivated.

<HTML>    NYON Switzerland AP  Juventus could face disciplinary action if it travels to Turkey on the day of its postponed Champions League clash against Galatasaray UEFA said Tuesday.    The European governing body said it sees no reason to exempt Juventus from a UEFA rule under which teams must travel to match venues by the day before a game.    Juventus had asked UEFA for permission to arrive in Istanbul Wednesday in a concession to players' misgivings over traveling to Turkey in the light of the country's political tensions with Italy.    The match is going ahead after a one-week postponement by UEFA over security concerns. Tension has declined since then.    UEFA said it sees ``no valid reason to grant an exception'' to competition rules which state teams must arrive at the match venue no later than the previous evening.    ``The clause is considered to be essential in order to allow smooth preparations for the match in particular for the visiting team'' UEFA said in a statement.    In a reply to the Juventus request UEFA said ``it will be the club's own decision to adhere to the regulations or not.''    If the Italian team travels Wednesday ``we would draw your attention to the fact that the matter would then be submitted to UEFA's disciplinary bodies'' it added.

<HTML>    HAVANA AP  Christmas is back on Cuba's official calendar after nearly three decades in which political and economic concerns made Dec. 25 just another day. Cubans said they look forward to the chance to play pray or just relax on the upcoming holiday.    The Communist Party used the entire front page of Cuba's only daily newspaper Granma to recommend Tuesday that ``from this year on'' Dec. 25 be a permanent holiday in Cuba. Adoption by the Communist government is assured.    Ordinary Cubans  whether religious or not  welcomed the news which re-establishes a custom the communist government abolished in 1969.    ``It makes me very happy'' said Marta Soler a secretary who came to the Our Lady of Carmen Roman Catholic church to buy nativity figurines.    ``It's another day to rest. ... You can share it with the family'' said Judith Arango Rodriguez 26.    Cuba's Roman Catholic Church issued a statement declaring that it ``highly values this gesture'' and expressing confidence that ``the path of opening of Cuba'' would lead to ``causes for joy unity and hope for the Cuban people.''    It said re-establishing the holiday was ``an act which does justice to our Christian-based culture.'' It also came after a request by Pope John Paul II who visited Cuba in January.    The government granted a Christmas holiday last year as a one-time favor to the pope but it had balked at declaring the measure permanent.    Despite increasing tensions between Cuban churches and a government that declared itself atheist in 1962 Christmas remained an official holiday in Cuba until 1969 when the government was frantically throwing much of the country's resources into an unsuccessful effort to harvest 10 million metric tons of sugar.    The government argued that holidays interfered with the harvest and also canceled the New Year's holiday that year. The New Year's holiday soon returned but Christmas remained a day of work.    On Tuesday the Communist Party said mechanization had reduced the need for manpower in the sugar harvest.    In its declaration the party insisted that the abolition of the holiday in 1969 ``was not inspired by any anti-religious sentiment'' and argued that the Cuban revolution had been far easier on churches than revolutions in France Russia and Mexico.    However the government at the time was avowedly atheist and often clashed with the Roman Catholic hierarchy.    Christians were barred from being members of the Communist Party and from holding many sensitive jobs. Even followers of Afro-Cuban religions were considered unreliable according to official documents.    Displaying a Christmas tree at that time could lead to conflicts with neighborhood Communist Party officials.    In 1976 Cuba's constitution guaranteed freedom of religion and in 1991 the Communist Party dropped its ban on religious believers. A year later Cuba declared itself a secular rather than an atheist state.    Restrictions on believers have fallen away and church-state relations have grown steadily warmer capped by the papal visit.    This year even state stores were selling plastic Christmas trees and ornaments.    Tuesday's declaration ``is a signal of an opening a rapprochement or reconciliation with the churches'' said Josue Ladron de Guevara 27 a Methodist minister from the eastern city of Santiago who was attending a religious workshop in Havana.    ``This is a dream that we have had for a long time'' he added.    In its statement the party praised churches for condemning the U.S. embargo of Cuba for sending aid and for speaking out in favor of social justice around the world.    But it also alluded to old frictions saying that ``counterrevolutionaries'' had long tried to create ``divisions and conflicts between religion and revolution.''    It noted that ``some members of religious institutions''  a reference to Roman Catholic leaders  had helped in the ``monstrous kidnapping'' of some 15000 Cuban children who were sent by their families to the United States in the early 1960s to save them from communist education in Cuba.    Arguing that abolishing the holiday had been strictly an economic decision the party said northern industrial countries were ``virtually covered in snow'' at Christmas and could afford to grant a holiday while tropical countries such as Cuba were in the midst of crucial harvests.    Most of Cuba's tropical neighbors however have always granted Christmas holidays.

<HTML>    LONDON AP  Men who detest Christmas shopping have a new excuse to avoid the chore  it's hazardous to the their health.    Male stress levels skyrocket when they're confronted with facing crowded stores choosing gifts and standing in check-out lines a new British study shows.    ``The peak stress levels were equivalent to emergency situations experienced by fighter pilots or policemen going into dangerous situations'' said psychologist David Lewis who did the research.    The study commissioned by the Brent Cross Shopping Center in north London sent about three dozen men and women of different ages to stores with identical Christmas lists. Some went alone while others were accompanied by children.    An accompanying researcher recorded periodic blood pressure and heart rate figures during the trips.    Every man in the survey suffered considerable increases in blood pressure and heart rates while only one in four women registered a significant change.    ``For men even the thought of going shopping was enough to send stress levels soaring'' Lewis said. ``Over 70 percent of them recorded above-average readings before even stepping out the front door.''    Most men surveyed admitted that the stress of Christmas shopping would make them choose the first gift they see rather than spend time in crowded stores considering the options.    The type of store can have an effect on men too. Retailers playing loud music in a crowded atmosphere sent blood pressures soaring in two-thirds of the men.    ``Almost all the women who went shopping with their partners regretted the decision and surprisingly stress levels were considerably lower for those who shopped with children than those who took boyfriends or husbands'' Lewis said.    ``The fact is that women cope better with shopping than men probably because they have more experience of it'' he said. ``If women don't want to let their men get off scot-free they should draw up a list of Christmas chores and get men to do something at home while they do the shopping.''    ms

Kinyua said whenever ``main crop'' or good quality lots of coffee from the current season come up there is strong demand an indication that prices could be firm in the months ahead.    Kinyua said increased supply of main crop coffee that will be in higher demand is expected to push prices higher in early 1999.    The last auction of the year will be held next Tuesday. The first of the new year will be held Jan. 5 1999.    Kinyua said a total of 16299 50-kgs bags were offered.    Following were highs and lows in dollars per 50-kg bag quoted by African Coffee Co.

<HTML>    THE HAGUE Netherlands AP  A genocide suspect who called himself the ``Serb Adolf'' seemed to enjoy murdering and torturing hundreds of Muslim prisoners of war a witness testified Tuesday at a U.N. trial.    Goran Jelisic a 30-year-old mechanic who has already confessed to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats is being tried for genocide the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's most severe charge. He committed the murders and beatings while working in a detention camp near the northern Bosnian town of Brcko in 1992.    ``I think he took pleasure in doing this because he was so powerful'' said a 53-year-old Muslim camp survivor identified only as Witness B. ``He said it was nice to kill.''    Witness B said he was taken to the Luka detention camp with two busloads of Muslims. He said Jelisic a Bosnian Serb immediately took all of their identification papers and personal belongings.    ``He introduced himself and said `My name is Goran Jelisic known as Adolf. You will get to know me well''' Witness B said on the second day of Jelisic's genocide trial.    Jelisic called out some of the names from the identification papers and said the people called would be executed then laughed and said he was only joking the witness testified.    He recounted how Jelisic interrogated two detainees who were not residents of Brcko. When they told him they were visiting relatives for May Day he accused them of lying Witness B said.    ``He said `This will by your last May Day' and took them out and killed them'' the witness said.    Earlier in the day another witness  also a Muslim  continued his testimony from Monday detailing how Jelisic allegedly brutally shot Muslims by holding their heads over a grate.    Jelisic and other camp guards tortured and killed people at will Witness A said calling Jelisic ``a beast.''    ``They simply knew we were Muslims and Croats. They simply wanted to eradicate us'' said Witness A who had to take a short break when he began to sob on the stand.    ``I think this was killing of pleasure out of some kind of hate against my people. Those of us that survived... we all believe he tried to inflict as much pain as possible'' he said.    During the testimony Jelisic sat calmly alternately leaning forward on the table in front of him or slumping in his chair.    By trying him for genocide U.N. prosecutors will be able to call evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders including the involvement of more senior Serbs.    Jelisic will be convicted of the 12 murders he confessed to and sentenced at the end of his trial which is expected to last well into 1999. He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for each offense.    Set up in 1993 by the U.N. Security Council the tribunal has convicted two Muslims two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder rape and torture but it has yet to register a genocide conviction.    km/bk

<HTML>    LONDON AP  English golfer Lee Westwood denies claims he dented and damaged his replica of the Australian Open trophy.    Colin Phillips executive director of the Australian Golf Union said the trophy had to be repaired by a Melbourne jeweler at a cost of 8500 pounds dlrs 14000.    Phillips said the cup was broken at the base and had dents in the top when officials opened its velvet-lined shipping box.    Westwood is not defending his Australian title this week opting for the Million Dollar Challenge in Sun City South Africa.    ``The trophy was returned on 21st September and duly signed for by the Australian Golf Union as being received in perfect condition'' Westwood said Tuesday from South Africa.    ``I am surprised that two days prior to the Million Dollar Challenge and the Australian Open they have decided to air their grievances.''    Australian officials are apparently upset about Westwood's withdrawal from the Australian Open and claim they got the news secondhand a charge Westwood also denied.    ``I withdrew on Sept. 2 explaining I had been invited to play in the Million Dollar Challenge with the world's top 12 golfers'' he said.    Westwood was criticized early this year for withdrawing on short notice from the Western Open in Chicago  the week after the U.S. Open. He also pulled out of the MCI Classic in South Carolina the week after the U.S. Masters.    In Sun City Westwood is trying to finish his season with a third successive victory having won twice last month in Japan.    scw

<HTML>    LONDON AP  Newspapers lashed out Tuesday after yet another humiliation for England's cricket team.    ``Day England lost all credibility'' said a blaring headline in The Express.    ``That's the worst I have seen in 83 test matches'' said The Mirror quoting England captain Alec Stewart.    ``One of our worst ever performances'' echoed The Sun.    England's seven-wicket hammering by Australia Monday in the second Test of the Ashes series  England was bowled out for 112 in 39 overs on the opening day  again reminded the nation how far it has slipped in a game it invented.    To make matters worse on the same day England was battered upstart Zimbabwe  the lowest ranked of the nine Test-playing sides  picked up its first overseas Test win when it beat Pakistan by seven wickets.    Writing under a headline calling England ``second-raters on cricket's world stage'' The Express columnist James Lawton said the loss reflected deeper problems.    ``It is not just the specter of another defeat which makes someone who cares for England's cricket legacy feel here like a man walking down Park Lane with holes in his shoes'' he said.    ``The grimness of this conclusion is that it may be that our cricket future is drifting beyond our own hands'' he added.    He was referring to a suggestion from former Australia captain Ian Chappel that England may no longer rate five-Test status against Australia.    ``I just don't know how we can keep handing out the five Tests to England when teams like Pakistan and South Africa are beginning to mean a lot more to the young people here'' he quoted Chappel as saying.    England has won just four of the last 30 Ashes matches to Australia's 18 and the defeat inside three days means Australia needs to win only one of the next three Tests to retain the Ashes.    The Daily Mail said even the Australian reserves were good enough to beat England.    ``Australia's second 11 could probably beat the tourists as well'' wrote columnist Bob Willis.    scw

<HTML>    KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia AP  The trial of jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim was put on hold Wednesday as the judge turned his attention to a lawyer who has accused prosecutors of forcing a man to lie about Anwar's alleged sexual trysts.    Manjeet Singh Dhillon accused of contempt of court is a lawyer for Anwar's former tennis partner Nallakaruppan Solaimalai who is being tried for illegal possession of ammunition a charge that carries a mandatory death sentence.    Nallakaruppan or Nalla as he is commonly known was detained under the Internal Security Act before Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest.    On Monday a warrant was issued by the court for Manjeet Singh after he wrote a letter accusing prosecutors of trying to force Nalla to enter into a plea bargain by giving false evidence against Anwar.    Authorities say 125 bullets were found in Nalla's house during a police investigation of allegations published in the book ``Fifty Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim Cannot Become Prime Minister.''    In the book it is alleged that Nalla set up sexual trysts for Anwar while the 51-year-old politician was still deputy prime minister and heir apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.    Proceedings against Nalla are separate from Anwar's trial for four counts of abuse of office. Anwar will face trial later for one more charge of corruption and five counts of illegal sex acts.    Both Anwar and Nalla deny the charges against them.    Manjeet Singh's letter formed the basis for an affidavit for which Zainur Zakaria a prominent lawyer on Anwar's defense team has been sentenced to three months in jail for maligning the prosecutors. Zainur will go to jail if he loses an appeal Friday.    The proceedings against Zainur and Manjeet Singh both eminent Malaysian lawyers and former presidents of the bar council have stunned the legal community. But there has been no public comment from the council the association of attorneys.

<HTML>    MEXICO CITY AP  Several alleged associates of a Mexican banker accused of fraud have been detained for investigation of money laundering in the Dominican Republic prosecutors announced Monday.    The weekend detentions  which netted three Italians two Puerto Ricans and two Dominicans  appear to strengthen conjecture that former banking magnate Carlos Cabal Peniche may have engaged in money laundering in addition to charges of bank fraud currently pending against him.    The detentions were related to ``illegal acts committed by Carlos Cabal Peniche in the Dominican Republic'' where he fled after charges were lodged against him in 1994 in Mexico the Attorney General's Office said in a press statement.    The alleged associates were detained by the Dominican National Office of Drug Control for questioning about their possible involvement in forgery and money laundering.    Dominican authorities have also seized properties on the Caribbean island which allegedly belong to Cabal who spent nearly four years on the run before his capture in Australia on Nov. 10.    Prosecutors charged Cabal with violating banking laws after he apparently misappropriated as much as dlrs 700 million from a bank he owned.    But the Monday announcement also raises questions about how Cabal built a business and banking empire in a few years in the early 1990s. While prosecutors have not announced money laundering charges against him press reports have repeatedly questioned the origin of his fortune.    Cabal rose from obscurity to the top levels of Mexico's business world mingling with political leaders in the early 1990s and winning control of two formerly state-owned banks Banco Union and Banca Cremi.    Authorities say Cabal made loans to himself from his banks a practice that is subject to strict limits under Mexican law and never paid the money back.    Mexico has said it will seek his extradition from Australia and announced Monday that Australian police have also detained Cabal's brother-in-law Marco Pasini for violating that country's immigration laws.    Pasini faces charges in Mexico relating to Cabal's alleged bank frauds and also faces an extradition hearing.

<HTML>    MONTREAL AP  Quebec's separatist premier Lucien Bouchard faced an awkward future Tuesday after voters returned him to power but made clear there was no groundswell of support for secession.    Backed by only 43 percent of the voters Bouchard's Parti Quebecois found itself still in control of the legislature yet lacking a mandate to press quickly for its paramount goal  independence from Canada.    Instead Bouchard and his foes agreed the government will have to focus on difficult unglamorous issues like job creation deficit reduction and shoring up eroding social services.    Bouchard had hoped for a decisive win in Monday's provincial election as a first step toward calling for a referendum on secession. He has pledged to hold such a referendum only when confident the separatists can win and he admitted Tuesday this is not now the case.    ``It's clear Quebeckers don't want a referendum right now'' he told a news conference. ``They want us to complete the reforms that we've started.    ``I personally trust that provided we succeed in those achievements we will create a momentum of confidence-building all over Quebec and in such a climate the winning conditions for a referendum will arise.''    After a 33-day campaign billed as a showdown over separatism Quebec emerged from the election with its political forces in almost the same position as after the last election in 1994.    The separatists won 75 of the legislature's 125 seats while the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party won 48 a third party called Democratic Action won one and one seat remained unfilled because of a candidate's recent death.    In 1994 the separatists won 77 seats to 47 for the Liberals while each side won about 44 percent of the popular vote.    On Monday the Liberals again won 44 percent of the votes while the separatists slipped to 43 percent. Democratic Action  which favors greater autonomy but not necessarily independence  won 12 percent behind its 28-year-old leader Mario Dumont.    The separatists were able to convert modest vote totals into a legislative majority because their support  mostly among the French-speaking majority  is spread evenly across much of the province. Anti-separatist support is concentrated in fewer districts mostly in and around multiethnic Montreal.    Liberal Party leader Jean Charest said Bouchard was now in a bind in danger of alienating mainstream voters if he maneuvers vigorously for a referendum or alienating Parti Quebecois militants if he does not.    ``One of the groups is going to be deeply disappointed'' Charest said. ``The members of the Parti Quebecois today have to feel very uncomfortable about the results.''    Charest who will be opposition leader in the legislature said Quebeckers ``want a government that's going to focus on making Quebec work as a society that will not divide us.''    One of the next battlegrounds for Bouchard will be upcoming negotiations pitting him and premiers of other provinces against the federal government. Several other provinces are now echoing Quebec's longstanding demands for more control over social spending and Prime Minister Jean Chretien must decide whether to cede some federal powers or risk giving Bouchard a new grievance.    One of Chretien's Cabinet ministers Quebec native Stephane Dion said threats of secession are not an appropriate way to extract concessions from the federal government.    ``It divides our society it hurts our economy'' Dion said. ``It gives to many Canadians outside Quebec the sense that Quebeckers are small kids and receive too much from the federal government.''    In some anti-separatist newspapers in English-speaking Canada the tone toward the Parti Quebecois was even harsher.    ``The tedious Quebec situation can and should be ignored by all Canadians'' wrote columnist Diane Francis in the Toronto-based National Post. ``Nobody's going anywhere without the full consent of everyone both inside and outside Quebec.''

<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  A Russian helicopter Tuesday rescued a three-man television crew that had been stranded on a remote Arctic island by bad weather and was running out of food and other supplies officials said.    The helicopter evacuated the trio which included a Russian a Japanese and an Australian who had been making a documentary on polar bears. The crew was taken to the port of Pevek the Ministry of Emergency Situations said.    There were conflicting reports on who organized the rescue. Ministry spokesman Viktor Beltsov said the rescue was organized by his agency using an Mi-8 helicopter hired from a private airline.    But the international medical emergency company AEA International SOS said it had organized the rescue according to Mark Crawford the company's spokesman in Australia.    ``They're in fair spirits'' Crawford said of the crew. ``They're surviving of course but they were down to their last three days of food.''    Crawford said his company had been hired to conduct the rescue by the filmmakers' employer Natural History Pty. Ltd. in New Zealand.    The film crew arrived on Wrangel Island on Sept. 2 and intended to leave Oct. 15 but were delayed by bad weather. The weather also prevented the Emergency Situations Ministry from sending a rescue helicopter.    The three were holed up in a cabin on the island's northeast coast about 550 kilometers 350 miles west of Alaska.    Their food supplies were running out raising concerns about the men. Residents of a village about 130 kilometers 80 miles from the hut attempted to take emergency supplies to the crew but were defeated by bad weather.    The temperature on the island has been around minus 30 Celsius minus 22 Fahrenheit with strong winds.    The Japanese crew member Tatsuhiko Kobayashi developed complications from a recent eye operation Russia's ORT television reported.    Emergency officials earlier offered to try to rescue the crew by snow tractor but the three reportedly turned down the offer because they would have been forced to leave most of their equipment behind ORT television reported.    Kobayashi is an employee of NHK the Japanese television company. The Australian is cameraman John McGuiness. They were accompanied by Russian researcher Nikita Ovsyannikov.    ren/ren

<HTML>    BRUSSELS Belgium AP  France's oil giant Total SA took over Belgian petrochemicals company Petrofina SA to create the sixth largest oil company in the world and the third largest in Europe the companies announced Tuesday.    The new company will be known as Total Fina and the move was the latest in a series of mergers affecting the global oil market. The new company will be quoted on the Paris Brussels New York and London stock exchanges a Petrofina statement said.    Petrofina's stock stood at 14250 francs dlrs 407.9 Friday before it was suspended for Monday's trading. The deal put the value at 19.482 francs dlrs 557.7 a jump in value of over a quarter.    The agreement is based on a share swap pact that gives 9 Total Fina shares for 2 Petrofina shares. The move gives Total a controlling stake of 41 percent in Petrofina.    A combined general meeting of shareholders has been called for Jan. 14 to approve the agreement. Total said a public offering on the remaining Petrofina shares will follow.    The move made Belgian investor Albert Frere who controlled 30 percent of Petrofina shares the biggest shareholder of Total.    Petrofina stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors that the company was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA Total SA and Italy's ENI SpA. Trading in shares was stopped Monday when a local newspaper broke the news a deal was near.    Petrofina which employs some 15000 people worldwide is one of Belgium's biggest industrial companies.

<HTML>    LONDON AP  England full-back Matt Perry has been ruled out of Saturday's rugby union Test against South Africa at Twickenham.    Perry suffered a concussion during last weekend's defeat against Australia and will be sidelined for three weeks England coach Clive Woodward said Tuesday.    With Paul Grayson and Will Greenwood still questionable with injuries Woodward called up David Rees and Alex King into the squad to provide cover at wing and fly-half.    Perry was injured in the final seconds of the 12-11 defeat against the Wallabies at Twickenham. Doctors said he should take off at least three weeks.    Grayson who limped off with a knee injury against the Aussies and center Greenwood who failed to make the match are still under treatment.    Woodward drafted King into his squad as stand-by for Grayson. Rees is likely to take Austin Healey's place in the wing.    Woodward did not call up an immediate replacement for Perry. It's expected that Mike Catt Grayson's replacement at fly-half against Australia will fill the full-back role.    The South Africa Springboks will set a world record of 18 consecutive Test victories if they beat England on Saturday. They would eclipse the New Zealand All Blacks' 17-match winning streak between 1965 and 1969.    ``I don't see any country going through a winning run of 17 or 18 Tests in the future'' Springboks coach Nick Mallett said.    sw

<HTML>    AMMAN Jordan AP  The brother of Iraqi opposition leader Eyad Allawi was found dead here of a gunshot wound to the head and Jordanian security officials said Tuesday he apparently committed suicide because of financial problems.    Emad Allawi 55 was found dead in the back yard of his Amman apartment on Saturday the officials said. They said an investigation was under way but ruled out that the death was a murder.    The London-based Al-Hayat newspaper on Tuesday quoted unnamed ``independent sources'' in Jordan as saying Allawi died in a way suggesting he was killed by assailants working on behalf of the Iraqi government.    The paper also quoted unnamed Western diplomats in Amman as saying the Iraqi government is known to have plans to kill top Iraqi opposition leaders including Eyad Allawi.    Iraqi opposition members in Jordan said Allawi had serious financial problems but they did not give details.    They also said Allawi's body would be moved to neighboring Syria this week for burial next to his wife who died of cancer earlier this year.    The security officials and Iraqi exiles spoke on condition of anonymity.    Emad Allawi moved to Jordan in 1995 to establish a trading company. He did not join opposition groups while in exile.    But there were reports that Iraqi authorities confiscated his property and financial assets in Iraq to punish him for the defection of his brother.    Eyad Allawi heads the Iraqi National Accord a group of former military leaders and diplomats who defected from Iraq and advocate the overthrow of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.  UR; snm-jjh/eap

<HTML>    PERTH Australia AP  At least one teenager who celebrated the end of high school by kicking to death a small kangaroo-like animal in an activity known as ``quokka soccer'' would be charged with animal cruelty police said Tuesday.    Authorities on Rottnest Island the small isle 24 miles 40 kms off the coast of the capital of Western Australia state found five of the marsupials stomped after weekend celebrations by school-leavers.    Island police Sgt. Merv Lockhart said he was waiting for a formal complaint to be lodged by the Department of Conservation and Land Management before charging an 18-year-old with animal cruelty after he was seen kicking a quokka.    ``He admitted to police he kicked it to impress his mates'' Lockhart said adding that an example should be made of him.    If charged under the Wildlife Conservation Act the teenager will face a maximum fine of Australian dollars 10000 U.S. dlrs 6300.    Up to 3000 people flocked to the island for a weekend of drinking and celebrations marking the end of the school year and the end of high school for the graduating class.    Police charged three teenagers with assault and one with possessing amphetamines and issued many warnings for drunk and disorderly conduct Lockhart said.    Rottnest Island is home to about 10000 quokkas the largest population in Australia. They are found elsewhere only in very small groups in the state's southwest. Quokka's are unique to Australia.

The uniform donated by the late actor's family will be presented among historic American combat aircraft at the Duxford Imperial War Museum at Cambridge the museum said Tuesday.    Stewart was already an Oscar-winning star when he flew 20 combat missions in World War II based at Tibenham England northeast of London. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the French Croix de Guerre.    He resumed his screen career after the war and made a total of 80 films the best known of which is the holiday classic ``It's a Wonderful Life.''    ``Jimmy Stewart was a great friend of Duxford'' museum director Ted Inman said. ``He helped greatly fund raising for the American Air Museum and we were sad he was never able to see the fruit of his works. This uniform on show to Duxford's 450000 visitors each year will remind us all that James Stewart was not only a fine actor but also a brave aviator who flew on perilous daylight missions from Britain.''    The museum didn't say when the uniform would go on display.    ms

<HTML>    GUATEMALA CITY AP  Human rights activists applauded the death sentences handed down to a Guatemalan civil patrol that carried out a 1982 massacre but said Tuesday that the military commanders who they said oversaw it must be punished as well.    A court in the central province of Baja Verapaz on Monday sentenced to death three former members of an army-trained civilian patrol for their role in the massacre of 130 civilians on March 13 1982 in what has come to be known as the Massacre of Rio Negro.    Their convictions were the first for crimes committed in Guatemala's 36-year civil war which ended in 1996.    ``The investigation must remain open so that the masterminds of the massacre including high-ranking military officers can be brought to justice'' said Walter Valencia of the Human Rights Legal Action Center.    The men were convicted based on testimony from the survivors many of whom had campaigned for years to bring the killers to justice.    The Rio Negro massacre was part of Guatemala's so-called scorched earth campaign to root out civilian support for the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity supporters. Hundreds of Maya Indian villages were razed during the early 1980s.    An estimated 150000 people died in Guatemala's civil war and thousands more were tortured or kidnapped. A report released earlier this year by a Roman Catholic Church human rights office blamed the army for nearly 80 percent of the killings.    Herlindo Hichos a member of the Missing Persons' Relatives Association said legal proceedings ``must be brought against those who ordered these criminal acts.''    Judge Otto Mayan Morales who handed the sentences said authorities were searching for another nine patrol members who participated in the massacre. But he said no soldiers were with the patrol during the massacre.    The sentences in the city of Salama 25 miles 40 kilometers north of Guatemala City came as another war-crimes case against soldiers reopened after a seven-month delay because the public prosecutor received death threats and resigned.    The trial of 27 Guatemalan soldiers accused in the 1995 Xaman massacre reopened Nov. 25 with a new prosecutor Alejandro Nunez Pivarel.    Nunez said he would call 25 witnesses including survivors of the attack in the village of Xaman. Eleven people  among them an 8-year-old boy  died when a military patrol opened fire on resettled refugees; 27 others were wounded.    The Xaman trial is the first in Guatemala to take members of the armed forces to court for any of the 424 massacres attributed to them during the civil war.

<HTML>    OSLO Norway AP  The risky job of nurturing peace in the troubled Kosovo province of Yugoslavia is at the top of the agenda for a meeting of about 60 European nations that opens Wednesday in Oslo.    The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is sending 2000 unarmed observers to Kosovo in hopes of ending the killing of ethnic Albanian civilians and keeping mainly ethnic Serb police and troops in check.    OSCE member delegations including 45 foreign ministers are expected to adopt a resolution at their two-day Oslo meeting giving full support to the difficult mission.    ``This is the biggest and most significant task the OSCE has ever taken upon itself'' said Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek who assumed the organization's rotating chairmanship in January.    Several hundred people have been killed and up to 300000 people mostly ethnic Albanians have been displaced since Serbia launched a crackdown on Kosovo separatists in February. Kosovo is a province of Serbia the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.    Faced with an imminent NATO airstrike against his forces Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed in October to a U.S.-brokered truce that is shaky and troubled by sporadic violence.    Vollebaek said about 400 monitors from the Kosovo Verification Mission are already in place in Kosovo and will continue arriving at the rate of about 250 a week until the full number is reached by the second half of January.    Vollebaek said a great deal of responsibility rests on Milosevic to ensure the safety of the observers and that NATO remains ready to protest the foreign monitors if the need arise.    ``But what I hope for and want is a political process that leads to a real political settlement'' Vollebaek said.    The Norwegian foreign minister was disappointed that some of the heavyweights of the OSCE including the United States and Britain were not sending their highest-level delegations.    Both U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Foreign Minister Robin Cook have said they cannot attend.    The meeting which lasts until midday Thursday will also touch on a broad range of European security topics including Bosnia the Russian breakaway republic of Chechnya and Albania.    Vollebaek also said Austria was expected to be elected to chair the organization for the year 2000 and that next year's OSCE summit would be held in Istanbul Turkey in October.    In addition to its 54 member nations such countries as Japan South Korea Algeria Egypt and Israel were sending observers.

<HTML>    POTSDAM Germany AP  Germany and France agreed Friday that fighting unemployment should be Europe's top priority throwing their weight behind a shift toward a left-leaning agenda among European governments.    French and German leaders also called for tighter international scrutiny of the financial world including highly speculative ``hedge funds'' seen as a way to counter economically damaging swings in the markets.    In a joint declaration after a two-day German-French summit the leaders said a jobs creation pact is needed to offset years of government austerity measures to get Europe ready for the single currency the euro being launched Jan. 1.    They called for putting ``the fight against unemployment at the center of European politics'' and urged member governments of the European Union to set binding goals for putting their citizens back to work.    The appeals bore the stamp of Germany's new Social Democratic chancellor Gerhard Schroeder hosting his first summit with Germany's closest European partner since he won September elections. Schroeder met both French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin at Potsdam outside Berlin.    ``On the threshold of the 21st century we are determined to deepen these relations in the interest of European unity and to give them fresh momentum'' the declaration said.    Both sides agreed to push plans to merge European aerospace industries to take on U.S. giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin though they didn't resolve the issue of French participation.    Schroeder told Chirac during the summit that he supports bringing together the British and German industries first if France doesn't join in from the start. He stressed though that the door would be left open to the French.    The big European aircraft makers  Daimler-Benz Aerospace British Aerospace and Aerospatiale  agreed in principle in March to seek a merger. Daimler-Benz Aerospace and British Aerospace are in advanced talks on a two-way alliance but one stumbling block to Aerospatiale's early participation is that the aircraft maker is still partly government-owned and progress toward full privatization has been slow.    With the euro binding 11 European economies closer together than ever before the leaders pledged to seek common European policies on taxes and workers' rights.    Schroeder called Monday for ``a new beginning'' in German-French relations Europe's most important partnership and traditionally the engine behind the drive for postwar European unity.    Germany and France hold summits twice yearly but this meeting has special significance because of the euro's debut and Germany's six-month EU presidency starting Jan. 1.    German demands to lower its contribution to the EU budget were one of the summit's more thorny topics. But German deputy foreign minister Guenter Verheugen said that the French showed ``great understanding'' for Germany's pressure which comes as the EU tries to streamline its budget and administration to get ready for new members from the former Soviet bloc.    Germany the biggest contributor to the EU budget annually pays in 22 billion marks dlrs 12 billion more into EU coffers than it gets out in funds.  UR; tc-cb

<HTML>    LILLE France AP  Medical tests suggest that cyclists on the Festina team expelled from the Tour de France this summer took banned drugs judicial sources said Tuesday citing a judge's report.    In addition to the presence of erythropoietin EPO a banned drug that Festina officials had already admitted using the report included new revelations that amphetamines were found in the tests of four cyclists.    The four named were Laurent Brochard the 1997 world road racing champion; Christophe Moreau; Didier Rous; and Pascal Herve.    But top Festina cyclist Richard Virenque said the figures vindicate his claim that he didn't take banned substances.    Judge Patrick Keil called Virenque and teammates Pascal Herve and Laurent Brochard to Lille to give them the results of tests carried out in July.    According to judicial sources who saw the report the results showed Virenque had a hematocrit level of 49.3 percent. The hematocrit level measures the proportion of red blood cells in a blood sample  one sign of doping since the substances increase red blood cells.    But Virenque's level is just within the limit of 50 percent set by the International Cycling Union the sport's governing body.    Herve had a level of 52.6.    Medical experts have been analyzing blood urine and hair tests since Festina team manager Bruno Roussel admitted during the race to the use of the banned substance EPO among cyclists.    Virenque and Herve both deny they knowingly took any banned substances.    ``The biological parameters demonstrate scientifically that I didn't take doping agents'' Virenque said as he left the hearing. ``Today I am relieved and I hope soon hope to get back on a bike. It is the end of a nightmare.''    Gilbert Collard Virenque's lawyer said that ``no traces of anabolics growth hormones amphetamines or masking products were brought to attention concerning Richard Virenque.''    However testing remains an inexact science and the results announced by Keil suggest that eight of Festina's nine cyclists took banned substances.    Virenque's future remains uncertain.    Festina has cut by half its budget for next season is renegotiating contracts with all its riders and has already said the Frenchman will probably not be a member of the team next year.    Three of the Spanish team's Swiss cyclists  Alex Zuelle Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier  have been banned from all competition until May 1 after they admitted taking EPO.    Three Festina officials have been put under formal investigation one step short of being formally charged: physiotherapist Willy Voet; team doctor Eric Ryckaert; and sporting director Bruno Roussel.    parf-ae-cb

<HTML>    ANKARA Turkey AP  Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Tuesday said that Italy or Germany should try a Kurdish rebel leader detained in Rome if Turkey's extradition bid fails.    Speaking to members of his center-right party in Parliament Yilmaz said that if Italy refused to hand over rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan ``the least you can do is to make sure that his crimes do not remain unpunished.''    Turkey wants Ocalan extradited but Italy refuses to hand him over as its laws forbid extradition to countries like Turkey where suspects may face the death penalty.    Ocalan is also wanted in Germany but German officials fearing trouble among its Kurdish and Turkish immigrant population say they will not seek his extradition.    ``You issue a warrant for crimes committed on your territory ... but then you shy away from trying him'' Yilmaz added in a clear reference to Germany. ``What kind of a legal state is this?''    Turkey has been angered by a proposal by the prime ministers of Germany and Italy for an international tribunal to try Ocalan which Ankara accuses of terrorism.    The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast since 1984 in a war that has killed 37000 people.    Turkey's approximately 12 million Kurds are not recognized as an official minority and are denied education and broadcasting rights.    sf

<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  Crime and suicide continue to rise in the demoralized Russian military with a growing number of officers taking their own lives because of late pay and poverty the Interfax News Agency reported Tuesday.    Citing Defense Ministry statistics the report said some 10500 crimes and incidents had been recorded in the armed forces during the first 11 months of 1998 compared to about 10000 in all of 1997.    The Russian military has been falling apart in recent years because the cash-strapped government can provide only a fraction of the funding budgeted for the armed forces. Soldiers and officers routinely go months without pay often live in appalling conditions and bullying and crime are rampant.    Overall the number of deaths in the military has declined the report said.    Some 500 servicemen were killed or died on active service compared to 600 deaths last year. More than 800 servicemen were killed or died in off-duty situations compared to about 1000 such deaths in 1997 the report without adding any further details.    But suicides are climbing with about 350 cases reported this year said the report without providing figures for last year. More than 60 percent of suicides involved officers and poverty and delays in salaries were cited as the main reason it said.    ren

<HTML>    LA MACHACA Colombia AP  Colombian rebels have no intention of giving up their weapons if a peace accord is reached with President Andres Pastrana's government a top guerrilla negotiator says.    ``The government knows that we're not going to surrender our weapons'' said Joaquin Gomez one of three subcomandanders representing the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC in a peace dialogue that has yet to begin.    ``They are talking with us because we have them and these same weapons will be a guarantee afterwards that the agreements are carried out'' Gomez 51-year-old chief of the FARC's southern military bloc told foreign correspondents on Monday in this remote southern hamlet.    The government has not set any conditions for the talks though Pastrana has appealed for a truce at least through the Christmas and New Year's holiday.    The rebels have refused to halt hostilities however and three soldiers and one police officer were killed in separate rebel attacks in northwestern Colombia authorities said.    Accompanied by a dozen bodyguards Gomez arrived in La Machaca which is little more than a cluster of huts along a dirt road driving a green Ford sport utility vehicle. His fellow spokesman 33-year-old Fabian Ramirez came in another vehicle and sported a Che Guevara wristwatch. The reporters arriving from the other direction had to first clear a rebel checkpoint.    Gomez said the FARC still does not consider that Pastrana has honored his promise to remove all soldiers from a 42000-square-kilometer 16200-square-mile swath of southern Colombia including La Machaca where the peace talks are to take place. Until the pullout is complete the former university lecturer added there will be no talks.    Pastrana says the more than 100 soldiers that remain at a military base in nearby San Vicente del Caguan the largest town in the pullout zone are unarmed and are there to support government negotiators.    But the FARC insists the soldiers be removed and Ramirez over the weekend accused the army of plotting to assassinate the group's 70-year-old commander Manuel Marulanda who founded the hemisphere's oldest and largest rebel band 34 years ago.    Nearly a month has passed since the government pullout was supposed to be complete and Gomez said ``the balance is not encouraging because they have not withdrawn.''    The rebel negotiators' next scheduled meeting with Pastrana's peace commissioner is set for Dec. 11.    Meanwhile more than 400 kilometers 250 miles away three soldiers were killed in an ambush by rebels of the National Liberation Army or ELN the country's second-largest guerrilla force the army said.    The soldiers had arrived to help a besieged police post in Cocorna Antioquia state which a column of about 100 ELN fighters attacked Monday evening said deputy police commander Gen. Alfredo Salgado. He said two police officers were wounded and seven missing and possibly captured.    In a separate action FARC fighters attacked a police post early Tuesday in San Francisco a town near Cocorna 180 kilometers 110 miles northwest of Bogota killing one police officer and wounding six Salgado said.    He said communications were lost with the town.

<HTML>    TEHRAN Iran AP  Iran will test an electronic warfare system capable of jamming enemy radar in large-scale maneuvers scheduled for later this week a military official said Tuesday.    He said that until now the Iranian navy only had the capability to defend against electronic warfare. But new systems developed internally will give Iranian warships the capability of jamming enemy electronics the official said. He spoke on customary condition of anonymity.    The five-day maneuvers code-named Unity 77 will be launched later this week perhaps as early as Thursday with 50000 troops participating.    The navy commander Rear Adm. Ali Akbar Ahmadian said Monday that Oman will send observers to the war games.    He said the maneuvers will take place in an area extending from the central Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf of Oman.    Iran has tried for a decade to conduct joint military exercises with Gulf states which are allies of the United States. But so far no Gulf country has agreed to take part because of Tehran's insistence that U.S. warships should leave the region.    The war games will involve missile-launching units of the Revolutionary Guards and mock ``electronic warfare will be carried out over a wide area'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.    Among the maneuvers' goals will be to assess Iran's defense against chemical biological and nuclear attacks IRNA said.    Iran concluded military exercises involving some 200000 troops on its border with Afghanistan last month after Afghanistan's Taliban militia killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.

<HTML>    ROME AP  A U.N. food agency said Tuesday that violence against aid workers is growing at an alarming rate and that it planned to train its staff on how to handle potentially dangerous situations.    The Rome-based World Food Program said 45 of its staffers had been murdered or died from work-related accidents or illnesses in the past decade. Nine field workers were murdered in 1998 alone with the latest slaying Nov. 14 when a staffer on duty at a warehouse in Kuito Angola was shot to death.    While previously only the staffers heading to the most dangerous areas underwent training WFP has now hired experts to teach all of its 4000 staff members emergency procedures including the use of satellite phones to relay distress calls and escape and evacuation methods.    ``All our people need to know how to react to emergency situations'' said WFP spokesman Jeffrey Rowland. ``Some of the areas we did not consider dangerous have been transformed into high risk areas.''    Rowland said that the agency had started setting aside funds to cover security needs for each operation. He said the funds would be used for everything from de-mining to boosting the number of military personnel escorting convoys depending on the risks of each project.    The agency has appealed to governments of host countries to help ensure the safety of its staff.    ``Host countries must agree that safety and security is a nonnegotiable issue and that WFP will suspend operations in a country if its personnel is placed in extreme danger'' said Arnold Vercken head of the WFP's security task force.    WFP also said it aimed to increase cooperation with other UN agencies to develop a worldwide U.N. security policy.    vg/vls

<HTML>    HONG KONG AP  The beleaguered Hong Kong economy was hit Tuesday with another string of bad news  the key stock index fell nearly 4 percent more companies announced layoffs and the financial secretary hinted at a second straight budget deficit in the next fiscal year.    Prominent U.S. think-tank Heritage Foundation said in a report released Tuesday that Singapore has unseated Hong Kong as the world's freest economy. Singapore has been trying to replace the territory as the region's leading financial services provider.    The blue-chip Hang Seng Index which fell 3.2 percent Monday plummeted further Tuesday morning falling below the psychological support level of 10000 points at one point.    It later reversed course closing the midday session at 10007.98  3.8 percent lower than Monday's close.    The index already has shed 6.8 percent since last Friday when the government announced that the economy shrank 7 percent in the third quarter the biggest decline recorded for Hong Kong in the post-War era.    ``People are worried about the surge in unemployment high interest rates and falling inflation'' said Michael Ng dealing director at Sassoon Securities.    More than 450 people have lost their jobs this week so far as a restaurant closed its doors Monday and two major companies  Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company and Citibank  announced layoffs.    Unemployment already at 5.3 percent the highest level since 1981 when officials started collecting such data is expected to climb further.    The territory also is bracing itself for deflation as spending continues to fall.    Despite the grim economic outlook Financial Secretary Donald Tsang warned in an address to business leaders Tuesday that the government has limited scope to increase spending and to cut taxes as the budget deficit grows.    On Monday the government reported that it posted a gaping 50.16 billion Hong Kong dollar U.S. dlrs 6.43 billion deficit in the first seven months of this fiscal year well above an earlier forecast of 21 billion Hong Kong dollars dlrs 2.69 billion for the entire fiscal year.    Tsang also hinted at a second straight budget deficit in the next fiscal year beginning April 1 1999.    It's unusual for the Hong Kong government which has traditionally followed the credo of never spending more than it brings in to run a deficit two years in a row.    In another blow to the battered economy the Heritage Foundation said Hong Kong has lost its title as the world's freest economy to Singapore.    At a news conference Edwin Feulner the think-tank's president said the government's unprecedented market intervention in August had cost it the title it had held for three straight years.    To drive out speculators who were trying to depress stock prices and drive up interest rates the government launched a stock and stock futures buying spree to prop up share prices and later change the rules in the futures trading to tighten control.    Tsang reiterated that the intervention was a one-time action.    ``We are not a command economy we are a free economy  by any fair measure the freest in the world'' he said. ``Hong Kong will never close its markets to goods or services. We will never have exchange controls.''

<HTML>    JAKARTA Indonesia AP  The death toll from a powerful earthquake that hit a remote island in Indonesia rose to 25 on Tuesday officials said.    The magnitude-6.5 quake hit Mangole island on Sunday night destroying buildings and houses and triggering landslides.    Initially six people were reported killed on the island about 1900 kilometers 1180 miles northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.    However the toll rose after reports were received from isolated villages said Budi Waluyo an official from Indonesia's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency in Jakarta.    Afraid that aftershocks might bring down their damaged homes about 7000 people slept in tents or in the open.    Widespread damage was also reported on neighboring Taliabu island but there were no reports of deaths there.    Local government officials said more than 150 people were injured and more than 180 homes and buildings were damaged on both islands.    Some houses slid into the sea. Roads were cut and bridges destroyed hampering search and rescue efforts.    Neither island has a major hospital. A local government official Karim Wamona said emergency flights were taking seriously injured victims to neighboring islands for urgent treatment.    Food and medicine were urgently needed officials said.    Five of the dead were killed when the roof of a timber factory collapsed.    Others were killed when their houses fell down. Some were killed by landslides.    One landslide destroyed Mangole's main shipping dock.    On Tuesday electricity supplies remained cut in many places and telecommunications with both islands were patchy.    The quake struck at 10:10 p.m. local time Sunday and was centered beneath the Maluku Sea about 370 kilometers 230 miles south of the city of Manado on the island of Sulawesi the Meteorological and Geophysics Agency said.    Mangole and Taliabu are part of the Maluku archipelago known in colonial times as the Spice Islands.    Earthquakes are common in Indonesia which lies astride the so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire''  a line of volcanically active areas that stretches from Central America and the western coast of North America across to Japan Southeast Asia the South Pacific and New Zealand.

<HTML>    MONTREAL AP  Quebec's pro-independence government was re-elected but won only 43 percent of the popular vote likely dampening its zest for holding a secession referendum soon.    The outcome of Monday's election means a new term of up to five years for Quebec's charismatic premier Lucien Bouchard who says he will call a referendum on independence whenever he feels the separatist side can win.    But he may need to wait a while for what he calls the ``winning conditions.'' His Parti Quebecois retained its majority in the legislature but was narrowly outpolled in the popular vote by its anti-separatist rival the Quebec Liberal Party.    With 94 percent of the 23000 polling stations reporting late Monday the separatists had 42.8 percent of the votes to 43.6 percent for the Liberals and 12 percent for a third party Democratic Action.    The separatists were on track to win 77 of the legislature's 125 seats the Liberals 46 and Democratic Action one with one seat to be filled later because the separatist candidate recently died.    The outcome was a virtual replay of 1994 when the separatists won 77 seats to 47 for the Liberals while each receiving about 44 percent of the popular vote.    Bouchard's main rival was Liberal party leader Jean Charest who tried to persuade voters that the province would prosper only if the decades-old threat of secession was abandoned.    Charest 40 became an early favorite when he quit federal politics in March to enter the Quebec race; in English-speaking Canada he was viewed as the potential savior of national unity.    But despite his family roots in Quebec he was widely perceived by the province's French-speaking majority as more of an outsider than Bouchard and less likely to do battle for the province in any confrontations with the federal government.    Bouchard 59 has maintained high popularity ratings despite overseeing painful spending cuts over the past three years in a drive to erase Quebec's deficit. Among Francophones he has never lost the mythic aura he gained when after losing a leg and almost dying from a flesh-eating disease in 1994 he came back to lead the separatists to near-victory in a 1995 referendum on secession.    Though Bouchard has served in the federal Cabinet and federal Parliament this was the first time he ever ran as a party leader in Quebec. He was appointed premier without an election in 1996 after his predecessor Jacques Parizeau resigned following the 1995 referendum.    There were 5.2 million eligible voters Monday and turnout was more than 80 percent even though this was the fourth province-wide vote in the past five years.    Analysts had suggested that a landslide separatist victory  approaching 50 percent of the popular vote  would lead to pressure from Parti Quebecois militants to hold a secession referendum quickly. Monday's results were considered more likely to prompt a cautious approach from Bouchard and perhaps a wait of a year or two before considering a referendum.    The separatists have lost secession referendums twice before once by a big margin in 1980 and just narrowly in 1995.    Bouchard anxious to avoid a third defeat said he would call another referendum only when he was convinced the separatists would win. In the meantime he says he would seek more autonomy for all 10 provinces particularly in regard to control over social programs.    Many Quebeckers supported Bouchard even though they oppose secession. Polls suggest only about 43 percent of Quebec voters would support independence now and about two-thirds do not want a referendum on secession in the next few years.    To woo these voters Bouchard tried to portray the election as the choice of the most competent leadership with the thorny question of a referendum to be addressed at a later date.    The Liberals' chances clearly were hurt by the relatively strong showing of Democratic Action whose leader 28-year-old Mario Dumont retained his seat in the legislature. His party which appeals to many young voters favors greater autonomy for Quebec but stops short of advocating outright secession.    About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from southern Europe Asia and elsewhere.    The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is different from the rest of Canada plus a yearning to manage their own affairs and have their own national symbols.

<HTML>    ATLANTIC CITY New Jersey AP  What's Saturday night at the fights without a cigar?    The operators of the Atlantic City Convention Center a no-smoking building will not enforce the ban when the building holds its first boxing match this weekend.    The exemption will apply only to sports events at the dlrs 268 million center which opened in mid-1997. Conventioneers and others who rent the building or attend events there won't be allowed to light up according to Gregg Caren assistant general manager.    ``When it comes to sporting events smoking is permitted'' he said. ``If it was a meeting or a conference we'd operate it as a no-smoking building. But at a boxing match anyone knows going in that they're expecting smoke.''    The center is operated by the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Authority just as Convention Hall is. Convention Hall the site of most major fights in Atlantic City is a no-smoking building as well but the ban is not enforced at sports events.    Promoter Don King who is promoting the WBA world bantamweight championship fight between Nana Konadu and Johnny Tapia said the issue never came up during negotiations for the fight which is expected to attract up to 6000 people.    It's healthier to skip the cigars anyway King said Tuesday.    ``Do like I do'' he said. ``Use 'em for a prop. Put 'em in your mouth and don't light 'em like I do.''

<HTML>    SIDON Lebanon AP  Hezbollah guerrillas carried out four attacks Tuesday against Israeli and allied militiamen in south Lebanon killing one fighter security officials said.    The victim was a member of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army who was killed in an explosion outside the town of Jezzine said the officials.    Another explosion in Jezzine 20 kilometers 12 miles north of Israel's panhandle wounded another SLA militiaman said the officials speaking on customary condition of anonymity.    Guerrillas also targeted joint SLA-Israeli military positions in the Lebanese villages of Blatt and Sojod both about 500 meters yards north of the Israeli border. No casualties were reported said the Lebanese officials.    They confirmed the attacks were carried out by Hezbollah.    The Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah or Party of God said in statements its guerrillas targeted outposts belonging to SLA and Israeli troops in the central and western sectors of an Israeli-occupied enclave in South Lebanon.    The attacks came amid mounting tension in Lebanon. Israel has threatened to bomb the capital Beirut to avenge the deaths of Israeli soldiers. Seven Israelis have been killed by guerrillas in south Lebanon since mid-November.    Hezbollah of the Party of God is leading a guerrilla battle to oust the SLA and Israeli soldiers from an enclave that Israel has occupied in south Lebanon since 1985.    Israel claims the occupation is needed to protect its northern towns from attack but the frequent deaths of Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon has raised debate in Israel about maintaining the occupation.

<HTML>    ROME AP  Police on Tuesday detained 26 people suspected of smuggling would-be immigrants and drugs across the Mediterranean from Albania.    Italian news reports said the suspects included Italians and Albanians. Several of the arrested own shipyards along Italy's southern coast and allegedly provided smugglers with powerful boats with secret compartments to transport drugs.    The government is attempting to crack down on the illegal trafficking of people and drugs by heavily patrolling Italy's long coastline. But dinghies filled with would-be immigrants continue to arrive almost on a daily basis.    Most are Kurds ethnic Albanian Kosovo refugees or northern Africans fleeing persecution or war at home. They usually pay smugglers huge fees for the voyage but are often left stranded several kilometers off the coast and many die trying to swim ashore.    vg

<HTML>    TAIPEI Taiwan AP  It's the last journey down the campaign trail for the man who brought democracy to Taiwan and President Lee Teng-hui is making the most of it.    Lee is putting on a lively show as he stumps across Taiwan to help fellow Nationalist Party politicians in campaigning for legislative and mayoral races ahead of Saturday's election.    In rural Chiayi city in the south Lee put on a straw hat and rode in to a rally site on a power tiller. In cosmopolitan Taipei Lee played star warrior and knight of the round table.    To appeal for party unity the 75-year-old Lee has also appeared on stages in a plumed hat as a tribal chief or wielding a bat as the head of a baseball team.    The vote could influence the outcome of the next presidential race in 16 months and is being watched closely by Beijing which considers Taiwan a part of China.    Lee says he will retire when his term ends after a career in politics that has seen him change with the times  now courting voters with flashy gimmicks rather than long speeches on policy.    But Lee still pushes the message that made him a giant of Taiwanese politics: The island will be governed by the will of the people.    ``Our party may be a hundred-year-old shop'' a smiling Lee told a rally ``but it has been re-opened as a modern department store. You name it and we can provide the service.''    Lee will campaign in each of Taiwan's 21 cities and counties at least twice before the elections underscoring his influence and popularity.    The president commands great respect for bringing democracy to Taiwan after coming to power in 1988. His charisma and his folksy style only embellish his popularity.    Lee's Nationalists go into the election after a humiliating defeat in local elections last December due largely to the party's corrupt image. But they are expected to retain their slim majority in a legislature being expanded to 225 seats.    Whatever the election outcome may be Lee can rest assured the causes he has championed  democracy and the assertion of a Taiwanese identity  have taken hold in Taiwan despite stirring anger in China.    ``These causes are reaffirmed again and again through elections'' said Antonio Chiang publisher of the Taiwan Daily News. ``Whoever succeeds Lee can only follow the tracks that he has laid down.''    Lee managed to peacefully end the rule of Taiwan's Chinese elite which are dominated by the family of Chiang Kai-shek who fled China in 1949 after losing a civil war against the communists.    As Taiwan's first native-born leader Lee has given Taiwanese a say in their own affairs while Chiang had sought to impose a mainland identity to reinforce his government's claim to represent all of China.    Lee's other campaign to raise the island's international profile has also angered Beijing almost to the brink of military confrontation three years ago. Most Taiwanese want to avoid changing the island's status and politicians are going along with that putting aside their own stances.    In the important Taipei mayoral race Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou the Nationalist challenger who has adamantly supported unification with China toned down his position and is campaigning under the slogan of ``Taiwan First Taipei First.''    Likewise incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party has said only that the people will be Taiwan's ultimate masters rather than spelling out the party's platform of independence which many Taiwanese fear could incite a Chinese invasion.

<HTML>    INDIANAPOLIS AP  The Indianapolis Motor Speedway once the exclusive domain of the Indianapolis 500 is expected to add a Formula One race in 2000.    Speedway president Tony George has scheduled a news conference for Wednesday morning amid speculation the international race series would return to the United States for the first time since 1991.    Spokesman Fred Nation would not confirm a deal had been finalized although two months ago he said George and Formula One president Bernie Ecclestone had met three times this year to discuss the possibility of bringing a race to the United States' most famous track.    George first submitted a proposal to Ecclestone in March.    At another meeting with Ecclestone in June George proposed a multi-year commitment reportedly calling for the Speedway to put up dlrs 10 million to host the race and spend another dlrs 15 million to build a road course in and around the existing 4-kilometer 2 1-2-mile oval track.    Other American cities believed to have made bids were San Francisco Las Vegas and Atlanta.    ``The difference with us and the other cities is that we have everything in place to do a deal tomorrow'' George said at that time. ``No one else does.''    The only Formula One race in North America now is the Canadian Grand Prix held in Montreal in June.    The Indianapolis 500 was the only race at the speedway until 1994 when the Brickyard 400 was added as part of NASCAR's premier Winston Cup stock car series. This year the International Race of Champions another stock car series sanctioned by NASCAR the National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing also made Indy part of its season tour.    The last Formula One race in the United States was at Phoenix in 1991. The series competed at Watkins Glen in the 1960s and '70s and was joined by a second U.S. Grand Prix in Long Beach California in the mid-'70s.    The Watkins Glen race was moved to the streets of downtown Detroit in the 1980s then because of escalating costs Long Beach and Detroit switched to Indy-car races and Formula One organized less successful events in Las Vegas Dallas and Phoenix.    A U.S. Grand Prix at Indianapolis would require major renovations that probably would begin immediaately after the 1999 Brickyard 400.    George earlier proposed using the track's existing first and second turns and most of the front straightaway although a new section of track for a road course would have to be built in the infield. Also installing the necessary 24 pit-side garages would require removing a portion of the grandstand behind the existing pit road.

<HTML>    BRUSSELS Belgium AP  France's oil giant Total SA took over the Belgian petrochemicals company Petrofina SA to create the sixth-largest oil company in the world and the third-largest in Europe the companies announced Tuesday.    The new company known as Total Fina will be quoted on the Paris Brussels New York and London stock exchanges a Petrofina statement said. The move was the latest in a series of mergers affecting the global oil market.    ``The combination of Total and Petrofina will allow the new entity to capture substantial productivity gains particularly in the North Sea and to expand its positions in the deep offshore United States Angola'' Petrofina said in a statement.    The market capitalization of both companies combined stood at 1391 billion Belgian francs dlrs 39.9 billion.    Petrofina's stock stood at 14250 francs dlrs 407.9 Friday before it was suspended for Monday's trading. The deal put the value at 19.482 francs dlrs 557.7 a jump in value of more than a third.    The agreement is based on a stock swap that provides nine Total Fina shares for two Petrofina shares. Total Fina will have a controlling stake in 41 percent of Petrofina which specializes in refinery.    ``In refining-marketing Total Fina will hold solid positions'' in the European Union. ``Joint management of the refineries and the marketing networks should yield substantial productivity gains'' the statement said.    A combined general meeting of shareholders has been called for Jan. 14 to approve the agreement. Total said a public offering on the remaining Petrofina shares will follow.    The move made Belgian investor Albert Frere who controlled 30 percent of Petrofina shares the biggest shareholder of Total Fina.    Petrofina stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors that the company was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA Total SA and Italy's ENI SpA.    Petrofina which employs 15000 people worldwide is one of Belgium's biggest industrial companies. It has interests in other enterprises including energy company Electrabel utilities company Tractebel SA and holding companies Companie National a Portefeuille Sidro Sofina SA Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA and Electrafina SA.

<HTML>    DIYARBAKIR Turkey AP  An explosion here Tuesday on a busy shopping street killed a young woman officials suspected was a Kurdish suicide bomber the Turkish news agency Anatolia reported.    At least nine people were injured in the blast in the town of Lice in southeastern Turkey the heart of the 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy.    The cause of the blast was not known but Anatolia said officials suspected a suicide bombing by Kurdish rebels.    The dead person was in her late teens the report said. Female militants have in the past carried out suicide bomb attacks in southeast with explosives strapped to their waists. Last month a Kurdish woman died setting off a bomb last month near a military garrison that wounded two others.    The blast could discredit claims by rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan who was detained in Rome last month that the group is renouncing violence in the struggle for autonomy for Kurds.    Close to 37000 people have been killed since Ocalan's group began fighting in 1984.    sf-fd

<HTML>    KHARTOUM Sudan AP  Sudan should let the market determine its exchange rate a former Sudanese finance minister said in remarks published Tuesday.    Sudan one of Africa's poorest states has three exchange rates. The official or the customs rate which currently stands at 2300 Sudanese pounds to the dollar. The commercial bank rate that fluctuates between 2302 and 2315 pounds to the dollar. And the black market where a dollar sells for 2340 pounds.    ``The unification of the official and black market exchange rates and the application of a foreign exchange market system as a mechanism for revealing the real rate'' would help the government Abdel-Rahman Hamdi said in remarks published in the newspaper Al-Usbu.        JIDDAH Saudi Arabia AP  The Saudi businessman Hani Yamani and Eritrean Airlines have put up dlrs 2 million to create a new airline Yamani's office said Tuesday.    Red Sea Airlines will be 60 percent owned by Yamani's Jiddah-based company Air Harbour Technologies and 40 percent owned by Eritrean Airlines.    In addition Yamani's office said Air Harbour Technologies plans to invest more than dlrs 150 million during the next five years to develop tourism on Eritrea's Red Sea coast.    The company plans to build six hotels and four airports on the coast and in the Dahlak archipelago a group of 300 islands in the Red Sea.        MANAMA Bahrain AP  Credit Suisse Bank is to close its office in Bahrain at the end of December an official of the bank said Tuesday.    The official speaking on condition of anonymity declined to give the reasons for the closure but said Credit Suisse would move its Bahrain operations to its regional office in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.    The Zurich-based Credit Suisse has had an office in Bahrain since 1975.    Bahrain is the Middle East's leading banking center. About 47 offshore banking units operate from the tiny Gulf island.        KUWAIT AP  The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange fell by 10.04 percent in November closing the month at 1777.1 points a market report by the National Investments Co. said Tuesday.    The decline was caused by low oil prices and the crisis between Iraq and the United Nations over weapons inspectors the report said.    A local controversy over a government proposal to pump money into the exchange also contributed to the fall the report said. The central bank governor Sheik Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah was reported to have resigned to protest a decision by a ministerial committee to allow investment companies to extend special loans to investors.    The dispute ended when the Cabinet allowed the central bank to decide if the exchange needed the extra funding.    The report said some 506.86 million shares changed hands in the 21 days of trading during November down 24.9 percent from those traded during the same number of days in October. The value of these shares also dropped by 34.41 percent to 99.43 million dinars dlrs 329.2 million. The figures were the lowest this year.    The exchange lists 77 companies but trading is restricted to Kuwaitis and nationals of the other five Arab states in the Gulf: Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Bahrain Qatar and Oman.        AMMAN Jordan AP  The number of ships docking at Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba fell by 14 percent to 2172 ships between January and October this year an official said Tuesday.    The decline was caused by the shrinking number of passengers taking the ferry from the Egyptian port of Nuweiba' said the director-general of the Aqaba Port Authority Mohammed Dalabeeh.    Dalabeeh declined to elaborate but he appeared to be referring to the Jordanian government's decision to impose stringent measures on Egyptians seeking work in Jordan.    Iraq Jordan's largest trade partner has used Aqaba for much of its imports since its own ports were heavily damaged during the 1991 Gulf war.    Dalabeeh said the total volume of goods handled at Aqaba between January and October this year was 10.4 million tones 2 percent more than during the same period in 1997.  UR; mo-de-jah-jjh-fsa-am-jbm

<HTML>    LONDON AP  The parents of a British woman convicted of heroin trafficking in Thailand have appealed to the British government for help in persuading the King of Thailand to reduce her 22-year prison sentence.    Sandra Gregory 33 was convicted in 1996 and sentenced to 25 years in a Thai prison after being stopped at the Bangkok airport with more than 100 grams 3.5 ounces of heroin. Her sentence was later reduced to 22 years under a general amnesty from the King of Thailand and she was transferred to a British prison last year under a British-Thai prisoner exchange treaty.    In a letter published in Tuesday's edition of the Scotsman newspaper Stan and Doreen Gregory say they believe the government should write to the King of Thailand requesting a reduction in the sentence.    The couple say their daughter was ill when she tried to smuggle heroin from Bangkok to Tokyo in 1993.    While they accept her crime was serious they contrast her case with those of other Britons convicted of drugs offenses in Thailand and the case of British nurses Lucille McLauchlan and Deborah Parry who were released after being convicted in Saudi Arabia of killing Australian nurse Yvonne Gilford.    The couple also cite the case of two women who were released from a Bangkok jail in 1993 after the intervention of then Prime Minister John Major. They had been convicted of having 4 million pounds dlrs 6.6 million worth of heroin.    er

<HTML>    GENEVA AP  UEFA and several of Europe's top clubs agreed Tuesday on a format for a new-look UEFA Cup competition.    The revamped competition merging the existing UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup should start with 96 teams UEFA's European Football 2000 Task Force decided. The same number of clubs participate in the opening rounds of the current two cups.    If UEFA's executive committee approves the proposal eight teams which fail to qualify from their Champions League groups will join the UEFA Cup in its third round.    ``It means we have more quality'' UEFA General Secretary Gerhard Aigner told reporters.    The cup will have one qualifying round. An alternative proposal with a smaller starting lineup would have required three summer qualifying rounds.    Under the Task Force proposal countries whose teams reach the UEFA Cup quarterfinals will receive an extra place in the following season's competition.    The group also discussed the financial structure of the revamped Champions League.    In October representatives of AC Milan Real Madrid and 10 other major teams agreed not to join a breakaway Super League after UEFA promised to extend next season's European Champions' League from 24 teams to 32 playing in eight groups of four in the first stage.    Clubs agreed Tuesday that 5 percent of the money they receive from the new competition should go to the leagues of participating teams Aigner said.    The money would be distributed to clubs which don't qualify for European competitions and ``must be used for education of young players'' he added.    The European governing body expects the new-look Champions League to generate some 800 million francs dlrs 570 million. Around three-quarters would be distributed to clubs under both the current system of match and performance fees and the clubs' market value.    UEFA's executive committee is expected to give final approval to the revamped competitions and decide on a starting date for them when it meets next week in Lausanne Switzerland.    ``We have set the sails for a start next season'' Aigner said. Top clubs want the new competitions to begin then to maximize their potential earnings.  UR; gm

<HTML>    MANILA Philippines AP  More than 500 overseas Filipino workers died between January and September this year and 936 others are being held in jails a government official said Tuesday.    An estimated 4.5 million Filipinos work abroad chiefly as housemaids entertainers and construction workers.    Marilyn Alarilla a Department of Foreign Affairs official said accidents crimes and health problems caused most of the deaths. Last year 576 Filipino workers died abroad including 156 women.    Alarilla said the government has worked to restrict employment of Filipino housemaids in some Middle Eastern countries where many cases of abuse have been reported in the past. Under the restrictions maids can work only for diplomats and government officials in these nations.    Philippine officials also require maids and most other women workers applying for work abroad to be at least 25 years old to ensure that they are mature enough to handle difficult workplace situations.    Of the jailed Filipino workers 356 are in the Middle East and Africa 359 in Pacific Rim countries 172 in Central and South America and 49 in Europe. More than 260 of those jailed in the Middle East are in Saudi Arabia she said.    Many Filipinos are forced to work in other countries because of a shortage of job opportunities at home. They often endure daily indignities ranging from verbal abuse to sexual advances from their employers. But Filipinos at home generally see them as privileged for being able to work overseas for higher wages.    Some officials estimate that more than 6 million Filipinos work abroad since many do not register with government agencies.    The money the overseas workers send home is the country's biggest source of foreign exchange in the Philippines.    In 1997 overseas workers sent home dlrs 5.7 billion through official channels and much more through other means helping soften the effects on the Philippines of the Asian currency crisis.

<HTML>    TOKYO AP  People across Asia handed out condoms and wore red ribbons Tuesday as part of efforts on World AIDS Day to raise awareness about the spread of the disease especially in underdeveloped countries.    In Japan the Health Ministry organized rallies and charity concerts in central Tokyo to spread the word about AIDS and express solidarity with those suffering from the disease.    ``It's extremely important to have an event every year to repeatedly remind people that AIDS exists'' said Dr. Yoshiki Sakurai an official of the Japanese Foundation for AIDS Prevention.    Events in Tokyo will culminate with the lighting of a tree decorated with home-made red-ribbons the symbol of AIDS solidarity sent in from across Japan.    Discrimination against AIDS sufferers remains a serious problem in Japan and the country still lags behind many Western countries in AIDS treatment facilities and education.    ``We have to move on from the current situation in Japan where people with HIV are isolated to one in which they are accepted as full members of society with jobs'' said Satoru Ienishi a member of Parliament.    Ienishi was among the thousands of Japanese hemophiliacs who contracted the AIDS virus through the use of government-approved blood products tainted by HIV.    ``The taboo against AIDS is so strong in Japan that people with HIV are less likely to die from AIDS than from economic difficulty'' caused by their alienation from society he said in a telephone interview.    In China the government marked World AIDS Day by opening its first exhibition on the disease featuring photos of drug users and AIDS patients.    The government also unveiled a new AIDS control program that will include a nationwide campaign to educate people on how to prevent AIDS. China is expecting a fourfold rise in AIDS cases within two years.    It has officially recorded 11170 HIV cases but Health Ministry officials estimate that more than 300000 Chinese have the disease.    In Hong Kong bars restaurants and nightclubs handed out beer coasters warning people to practice safe sex as part of a three-week AIDS awareness program organized by support group AIDS Concern.    The colorful coasters feature pictures of a fluorescent condom on one side with a safe sex messages on the reverse.    One version of the coaster reads: ``Do it safely; use a condom every time.''    Aids Concern also handed out 5000 condoms at subway stations in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning.    The theme of the 11th World AIDS Day is ``Be a force for change.''    Experts have warned recently that although powerful new drugs have sent AIDS deaths plunging in industrialized countries the disease continues to kill millions of people in impoverished nations in Africa and Asia.    According to a new U.N. report about 33.4 million people around the world are infected with HIV two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa. Two million people will die of the disease south of the Sahara this year four times the total for the rest of the world.    About 1.7 million people in Africa and 700000 people in Asia and the Pacific are infected with HIV every year according to U.N. figures.    The Cambodian government marked AIDS day with the grim announcement that 150000 people  1.3 percent of the population  are infected with the AIDS virus.    Officials said that 50 to 70 people catch HIV in Cambodia every day the highest HIV infection rate in Asia.    The economic crisis sweeping through Southeast Asia has made it even more difficult for governments in the region to curb the spread of AIDS.    On the eve of AIDS day Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa launched a plea at the United Nations for governments around the world to contribute more funds to the worldwide fight against AIDS.    ``We aren't doing enough to say to governments for goodness sake why have so much money for death and so little for life'' Tutu said    U.S. President Bill Clinton prepared to mark AIDS day with the announcement of dlrs 10 million in emergency grants to help poorer nations care for children orphaned by AIDS.

<HTML>    JERUSALEM AP  Archaeology one of Israel's biggest tourist attractions suffered a blow Tuesday when most of its excavations were shut down.    The Israel Antiquities Authority halted its salvage digs  carried out ahead of most construction projects  after the Supreme Court ruled that developers and builders cannot be billed for these excavations.    In the country of Jesus and King Solomon Richard the Lion Hearted and Saladin the Arab conqueror who battled the crusaders in the streets of Jerusalem it is almost impossible to start a building or a road without uncovering ancient remains.    In response to a petition from a developer however the Supreme Court ruled Sunday that the government not the builder must bear the costs of the salvage digs operated by the Antiquities Authority.    In response the Antiquities Authority decided Tuesday to halt all salvage digs which account for about 300 of the 350 excavations carried out in Israel each year.    ``We have no budget for salvage digs'' said Antiquities Authority spokeswoman Osnat Gouez.    Major digs open to the public like those in Jerusalem Caesarea and Beit Shean have been drastically curtailed for lack of government funding Gouez said.    In the archaeological sense Israel is the one of the most crowded countries in the world with some 25000 known sites excavated or waiting to be dug up.

<HTML>    JERUSALEM AP  Palestinians stepped up their demands Tuesday for the release of prisoners jailed for anti-Israel acts but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not budge on the issue.    At a rally for prisoner releases in the West Bank city of Ramallah Ahmed Qureai speaker of the Palestinian legislature alluded to the six-year Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation when he told the crowd ``the leadership that threw stones is prepared once again to throw stones in order to free the people and to free the land.''    The comments drew a sharp response from Israel. ``The prime minister will not tolerate threats of violence'' read a statement issued by Netanyahu's office.    Ahmed Tibi an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat appealed to U.S. President Bill Clinton to resolve growing tensions over Israel's refusal to release so-called security prisoners.    Netanyahu said he could not release prisoners who had been involved in attacks on Israelis. ``I will not back down on this'' he vowed.    The issue which has prompted clashes between stone-throwing Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers is raising concern about an outbreak of violence in advance of Clinton's Dec. 12-15 visit to Israel and the Palestinian-ruled lands.    The Israeli daily Haaretz reported that Israeli security officials had urged Netanyahu to agree to free more Palestinian activists in order to prevent rioting.    Palestinians claim that Israel promised at the Wye River summit last month to free 750 prisoners from political factions such as Arafat's Fatah group. Israel released 250 prisoners last month but most were car thieves and petty crooks.    ``This deception is creating demonstrations anger and frustration in the Palestinian community'' Tibi told a Foreign Press Association news conference.    Demonstrations have been held almost daily in support of Palestinian prisoners with some of the anger turned on Arafat and his government.    Several hundred demonstrators gathered at rallies in Ramallah and in the Gaza Strip where about 150 children called for the release of their fathers.    ``How can we live without our fathers?'' said Fidda Washah 16 who addressed the rally. Her father Jabar a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine faction has served 14 years of a life sentence for attacking Israeli soldiers.    Netanyahu said he would not release anyone ``with blood on their hands'' or members of the Islamic militant group Hamas.    ``The Palestinians are claiming falsely that I suggested somehow to free murders at Wye'' Netanyahu told reporters.    Israeli officials say only about 110 of the 2500 Palestinian activists behind bars could be let go in the next release scheduled to take place just after Clinton's visit.    Tibi who was spokesman for the Palestinian delegation at Wye Mills Maryland said only about 300 of the Palestinians currently in jail had been involved in attacks that killed Israelis. The rest he described as ``political prisoners.''    He said about 1250 prisoners who were members of various PLO factions and the remainder belonged to Hamas.    ``We would very much like him Clinton to interfere in the issue of Palestinian prisoners'' said Tibi.    David Bar-Illan a senior adviser to Netanyahu said Israel would not agree to loosen the definition and free Palestinians involved in attacks that only injured Israelis.    ``We will not budge on this one'' Bar-Illan said adding Israel had freed more than 7000 prisoners over the past five years.    Palestinian officials called on residents of the West Bank to confront Israeli bulldozers that are expanding settlements or building roads to link Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank and Israel.    ``Settlement activity should be resisted'' said Tibi. ``Settlers are public enemy No. 1 to Palestinians.''    Several members of the Palestinian legislative council are considering a boycott of Clinton's speech in Gaza City on Dec. 14 to show their anger over a failure by the United States to pressure Israel on the settlement and prisoner issues.

<HTML>    BRUSSELS Belgium AP  European Union finance ministers failed Tuesday to narrow differences over how to pay for plans to bring up to 12 new members into the Union over the coming decade.    British French and German ministers said there was growing support for plans to freeze EU spending up to 2006 around current levels of 85 billion European currency units dlrs 100 billion a year.    But less well off EU members  Spain Portugal Greece and Ireland  are seeking an increase in spending to ensure they don't lose out when even poorer nations in central and eastern Europe join the club.    ``It is a difficult area sufficient progress has not been made'' said Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger who chaired the day-long meeting.    The finance ministers had hoped to draw up guidelines on the budget debate to the leaders of the 15 EU nations who hold their year-end summit next week in Vienna.    Although the leaders are hoping to move the issue forward in the Austrian capital they have set a deadline of next Spring to overhaul the budget.    Complicating the question are demands by Germany the Netherlands Austria and Sweden for a reduction in their membership dues to the EU.  UR; pa

<HTML>    BUENOS AIRES Argentina AP  Argentina's San Lorenzo hopes a well-rested squad will give them a lift over Brazil's Cruzeiro Wednesday to advance to the Mercosur Cup finals.

<HTML>    TOKYO AP  A major Japanese insurer is looking into a possible tie-up with U.S. discount brokerage Charles Schwab and Co.    Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co. said Wednesday that no decision has been reached.    Leading financial daily the Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Wednesday that the two companies plan to set up an Internet-brokerage venture in Japan with capital participation from three other companies in Tokio's Mitsubishi group.    If the deal materializes Tokio Marine and Fire will be the first Japanese nonlife insurer to enter the securities business under the so-called Big Bang a much publicized program by the Japanese government to ease regulations and stimulate competition.    The Big Bang is expected to facilitate foreign participation in the Japanese financial markets over the next several years.    In recent months several Japanese banks also announced major tie-ups with foreign banks.    Nihon Keizai said the two companies are expected to work out an agreement by the end of December. The two will draw up a marketing plan before April 1999 and the new brokerage will start in the summer it said.    The joint venture will market an array of financial products to individuals mainly on the Internet Nihon Keizai said.    The venture will market through Tokio Marine's network of insurance agents as well as its own branches in addition to a telephone center handling direct sales.    The joint venture is expected to be capitalized at between 10 billion yen and 20 billion yen dlrs 82 million and dlrs 164 million with Charles Schwab holding a 50 percent share and Tokio Marine 30 percent.    Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. and Meiji Life Insurance Co. are likely to take stakes of 5 percent or 10 percent each Nihon Keizai said.  UR; may-dj

<HTML>    MADRID Spain AP  Chile's foreign minister said Tuesday that his government is considering legal action against Gen. Augusto Pinochet but ruled out a deal guaranteeing he'd stand trial at home if Britain rejects an extradition request from Spain.    The minister Jose Miguel Insulza has argued that it is unnecessary to try Pinochet in Spain for crimes committed during his 1973-1990 dictatorship. A government lawsuit would strengthen his case.    ``The government is studying whether to join existing suits'' filed this year in Chile Insulza said. ``The possibility of a trial in Chile exists and gets larger every day.''    Human rights activists have dismissed the possibility of a Chilean trial for the former dictator since has wide-ranging immunity at home.    A Chilean government report says 3197 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the police after Pinochet seized power in a military coup that toppled the democratically elected president Salvador Allende.    Chile Insulza said was ``under no obligation'' to promise that the 83-year-old retired general would stand trial if allowed home from London where he has been under police guard since being detained Oct. 16 while recuperating from back surgery.    Insulza insisted that a Spanish judge's attempt to extradite Pinochet on charges of genocide terrorism and torture was an affront to Chilean sovereignty and its transition to democracy.    According to Insulza who is pressing for Pinochet's release Chile should be allowed to deal with the legacy of general's 17 years in power without interference.    Pinochet has many supporters there is widespread fear of violence if he is prosecuted.    ``There is no reason to call into doubt the solidity of democracy in Chile or our capacity to resolve our own problems'' Insulza said after stressing that the affair had triggered ``polarization break down of dialogue and sharp political confrontation.''    Spain's foreign minister Abel Matutes said the Spanish government was powerless to act since all remaining decisions on Pinochet's fate were in British hands. Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar reiterated that message in a 40-minute meeting Europe Press reported quoting government officials.    Earlier Tuesday Insulza met Supreme Court Deputy President Luis Lopez and Senate President Juan Ignacio Barrero.    Prior to arriving Monday in Madrid Insulza spent four days lobbying the British government whose Home Secretary Jack Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to let extradition proceedings go ahead.    Insulza said his trip had produced ``some positive indications'' but he declined to give details.    He was to meet Spanish business leaders before leaving for Chile on a Tuesday night flight.

<HTML>    BRUSSELS Belgium AP  France's oil giant Total SA has agreed to take over Belgium's Petrofina SA to create the sixth-largest oil company in the world seeking to cut costs in an increasingly competitive sector deflated by low crude prices.    The move was the latest in a series of mergers affecting the global oil market. The new company known as Total Fina will seek quotation at the Paris Brussels New York and London stock exchanges a joint statement said.    ``The move is part of global change oil prices have practically been cut in half over the past year. All companies are seeking to survive in this new situation'' said Total Chairman Thierry Desmarest. ``The business environment will be tougher than in the past years.''    The agreement is based on a stock swap that provides nine Total shares for two Petrofina shares. When the operation will be over Total will control about 41 percent of Petrofina Belgium's largest industrial company. It will bid for the rest of the Petrofina shares later.    The market capitalization of both companies combined stood at 1391 billion Belgian francs dlrs 39.9 billion. The new group would employ 69100 people. The companies said the employment totals would largely remain the same under the new company.    The Paris stock exchange was not immediately convinced and Total shares took a big hit falling almost 10 percent in early trading Tuesday.    ``When you add a sliding dollar and sluggish crude oil prices to the fact that investors have no details yet to gauge the benefits of the Petrofina takeover you get a tumbling stock'' said a Paris trader.    Petrofina's stock stood at 14250 francs dlrs 407.9 Friday before it was suspended for Monday's trading. The deal put the value at 19.482 francs dlrs 557.7 a jump in value of more than a third.    ``We have to recognize that the value today is higher than what we could get as a stand-alone company in the medium term'' said Francois Cornelis head of Petrofina.    The merger comes amid many changes in the oil industry. In August British Petroleum announced a dlrs 49 billion takeover of Amoco Corp. And The Washington Post reported Tuesday that an agreement had been reached for Exxon Corp. to buy Mobil. The oil companies the two largest in the United States say only that talks are ongoing.    Petrofina stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors that the company was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA Total SA and Italy's ENI SpA.    ``The combination of Total and Petrofina will allow the new entity to capture substantial productivity gains particularly in the North Sea and to expand its positions in the deep offshore United States Angola'' a joint statement said.    ``In refining-marketing Total Fina will hold solid positions'' in the European Union. ``Joint management of the refineries and the marketing networks should yield substantial productivity gains'' the statement said.    A combined general meeting of shareholders has been called for Jan. 14 to approve the agreement. Total said a public offering on the remaining Petrofina shares will follow.    Petrofina which employs 14700 people worldwide is one of Belgium's biggest industrial companies. It is best known for its refining and distribution operations in Europe and the United States.    Total SA employs 54400 and is the smaller of France's two oil companies and has aggressively expanded its upstream business mainly through exploration and especially in gas.  UR; rac-dj

<HTML>    MADRID Spain AP  Chile's foreign minister said Tuesday that a Spanish judge's attempt to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet has polarized his homeland but poses no threat to Chilean democracy.    Jose Miguel Insulza began a round of talks Tuesday with Spanish officials attempting to persuade them to drop the extradition request so Pinochet can go home.    Acting on a Spanish judge's request police arrested Pinochet on Oct. 16 at a London clinic where he was recuperating from an operation. He faces charges of murder torture and genocide in Spain.    Insulza came here Monday after a four-day visit to Britain where he tried to persuade the Labor Party government not to extradite the 83-year-old former dictator.    Insulza met early Tuesday with Luis Lopez Supreme Court vice president and Juan Ignacio Barrero president of the Senate. He was scheduled to meet later in the day with Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and Foreign Minister Abel Matutes.    ``Democratic stability in Chile is not at risk'' Insulza said after his meeting with Barrero but urged a quick solution because ``it's affecting my country very much.''    Shortly after arriving Monday in Madrid Insulza said that the political climate in Spain would make a fair trial for Pinochet impossible.    Insulza said Pinochet could be tried in Chile if he is allowed to go home. Pinochet has immunity from prosecution in Chile and critics say even if this were lifted he would appear before a military court packed with his supporters.    British Home Secretary Jack Straw has 10 more days to decide whether to let Spain go ahead with extradition proceedings.    A Chilean government report says 3197 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the police after Pinochet seized power in a military coup that toppled democratically elected President Salvador Allende.

<HTML>    LONDON AP  Men who detest Christmas shopping have a new excuse to avoid the chore  it's hazardous to the their health.    Male stress levels skyrocket when they're confronted with facing crowded stores choosing gifts and standing in check-out lines a new British study shows.    ``The peak stress levels were equivalent to emergency situations experienced by fighter pilots or policemen going into dangerous situations'' said psychologist David Lewis who did the research.    The study commissioned by the Brent Cross Shopping Center in north London sent about three dozen men and women of different ages to stores with identical Christmas lists. Some went alone while others were accompanied by children.    An accompanying researcher recorded periodic blood pressure and heart rate figures during the trips. Further information regarding how survey participants were chosen and specific numbers of men and women involved were not immediately available.    Every man in the survey suffered considerable increases in blood pressure and heart rates while only one in four women registered a significant change.    ``For men even the thought of going shopping was enough to send stress levels soaring'' Lewis said. ``Over 70 percent of them recorded above-average readings before even stepping out the front door.''    Most men surveyed admitted that the stress of Christmas shopping would make them choose the first gift they see rather than spend time in crowded stores considering the options.    The type of store can have an effect on men too. Retailers playing loud music in a crowded atmosphere sent blood pressures soaring in two-thirds of the men.    ``Almost all the women who went shopping with their partners regretted the decision and surprisingly stress levels were considerably lower for those who shopped with children than those who took boyfriends or husbands'' Lewis said.    ms

<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  President Boris Yeltsin is feeling better but is still spending part of the day in a hospital bed as he continues to be treated for pneumonia officials said Tuesday.    A Kremlin spokesman said the president was doing limited paperwork and there were no plans for any meetings or visitors. He did not say how much longer Yeltsin would remain in the government hospital where he has been for 10 days.    Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev said Tuesday that the president is expected to return to work at the Kremlin ``in the nearest time.''    ``Doctors are having trouble keeping the president in the hospital'' Sysuyev said at a news conference.    The 67-year-old leader is known as a restless patient who sometimes ignores the advice of his doctors.    Dr. Renat Akchurin who had conducted Yeltsin's heart bypass surgery two years ago said the president's repeated illnesses may be due to a weakened immune system.    Akchurin said that he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months but said heart problems appeared unlikely according to an interview with the weekly Argumenty i Fakty cited by the Interfax news agency. He also dismissed speculation that his heart surgery had affected the president's brain.    Yeltsin met his chief-of-staff Valentin Yumashev in the hospital Monday and was briefed on government and national affairs.    On Tuesday the president spoke by telephone with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to discuss the agenda of the premier's talks with International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus who arrived in Moscow later on Tuesday.    Russian television showed brief footage of Yeltsin dressed in a white shirt and dark cardigan and looking pale listening intently to his aide and nodding periodically. Like most footage of Yeltsin released in recent weeks Monday's tape didn't contain any sound of the president speaking.    Yeltsin's repeated illnesses and his infrequent public appearances have raised concerns about his ability to lead the country  now mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse  through the end of his term in mid-2000.    Sysuyev reiterated on Tuesday that Yeltsin will concentrate on political matters leaving day-to-day management of economic matters to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. ``You shouldn't think that the president and his office aren't taking part and controlling the economic developments such as preparing next year's budget and tax reform'' he said.    Yeltsin has remained out of public view throughout the latest economic crisis that hit in mid-August further eroding his sagging popularity.    ``It's known that the president now doesn't have sufficiently high popularity to put it mildly'' Sysuyev said according to the Interfax news agency. He insisted however that the president continues to play a stabilizing role in Russian society blunting antagonism between different political forces.    pvs/ad/adc

<HTML>    PARIS AP  Two of Europe's largest drug makers Hoechst of Germany and Rhone-Poulenc of France announced Tuesday they are merging their pharmaceutical and agrochemical operations.    The new company will be called Aventis and will be based in Strasbourg eastern France.    The move was a step toward a full merger between the French and German companies which should be completed within three years said Rhone-Poulenc chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou. Analysts have warned against a full merger until the heavily indebted firms reduce costs.    ``Unlike what has happened to other companies in our industry the creation of Aventis  provided we obtain all the necessary authorizations  will be translated into reality'' Fourtou said ahead of a news conference in Strasbourg.    A statement released by the two companies said it was ``anticipated'' that Hoechst Chairman Jurgen Dormann would be the new chairman of Aventis and Fourtu the vice chairman.    With annual sales of around dlrs 20 billion the new company will be tied for the No. 1 ranking with Switzerland's Novartis in the life-sciences sector.    The two companies said they expected annual cost savings of dlrs 1.2 billion in three years with 60 percent of those generated in their pharmaceutical operations and 40 percent in agrochemicals.    Unions in France and Germany have been critical of the merger fearing layoffs. Hoechst employs 118000 workers and Rhone-Poulenc 68000.    Rhone Poulenc shares were 4.2 percent lower to 271.8 francs dlrs 47.70 per share in afternoon trading as investors expressed displeasure that a full merger hadn't been announced.    sp-jn-dj

<HTML>    CHICAGO AP  Doctors hope they can soon destroy some cancerous breast tumors with lasers and high-tech imaging  all without the scars that can come with surgery.    The procedure which amounts to a nonsurgical breast lumpectomy was studied on 15 patients in the past year. One of them was Lena Hoffman 81 of Little Rock Arkansas. ``I cleaned house the next morning'' she said.    Researchers said the procedure would be for cancer detected in the early and sometimes middle stages but not in advanced cases.    Steven Harms professor of radiology and director of imaging research at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock was the lead researcher. He plans to present the findings Friday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago.    ``It's early and more studies are necessary but it is a very promising alternative for women who want to avoid disfiguring surgery'' Harms said Monday. ``Because we don't make an incision there is no scar and virtually no evidence of surgery.''    Harms said the laser procedure can be done on an outpatient basis and requires minimal recovery time compared with more expensive and painful lumpectomies and mastectomies.    The patients involved in the study later underwent either a mammogram or a lumpectomy. The laser-targeted cancerous tissue had been destroyed in all cases Harms said.    A specialized interactive form of magnetic resonance imaging known as RODEO MR allowed doctors to see the tumors as they treated the patients.    Under the procedure the doctor places a needle in the tumor and then advances a fiber optic wire through it. The wire is used to apply laser heat for about 10 minutes a process called ablation. The tumor is heated and destroyed.    A physician not involved in the research Dr. David Kinne said the procedure sounded promising but was concerned with the small number of patients involved and the short follow-up time.    Kinne professor of surgery and chief of breast services at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York also questioned how accurate RODEO MR would be in determining a tumor's size and other characteristics. And he wondered how doctors would determine the need for subsequent treatment such as chemotherapy.    However all that ``doesn't mean it doesn't need to be explored'' Kinne said.    Harms said doctors can tell from a biopsy what follow-up treatment is needed and said the RODEO MR is ``extremely accurate'' in determining a tumor's size.    Hoffman was optimistic after her success with the procedure.    ``I think it will encourage young women to come in and have their mammograms and their examinations if they have the assurance of not destroying the breast'' she said.

<HTML>    LONDON AP  Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet left a north London psychiatric hospital Tuesday driven away to an undisclosed destination in an ambulance in a covoy headed by police vehicles.    The ambulance swept through the gates of Grovelands Priory a day after the hospital announced that the 83-year-old general did not need medical care and demanded that he leave.    The move by the hospital where Pinochet has been since Oct. 29 dealt a blow to any plan he had to plead he is too ill to be extradited to Spain to stand trial on charges of genocide and torture.

A spokesman for the Roman club which is owned by Italian industrialist Francesco Sensi said Tuesday that negotiations with Nice had entered the final stage.    ``But the formal final agreement has not yet been reached'' the spokesman said.    Club officials said the control of the French team was intended to grant Roma the possibility to fish for young players in France and in other countries.    ``Nice would be a sort of breeding-ground for young players and for those players Roma can't immediately field'' the spokesman explained.    Roma is currently second to Fiorentina in the Italian League standings while Nice is the last-place in the 20-team French second division.  UR; pv

<HTML>    LONDON AP  Chris Ofili notorious for incorporating lumps of elephant dung in his paintings on Tuesday was awarded this year's Turner Prize the most high-profile award of the contemporary art year.    Ofili 30 from Manchester is the first painter to win the prize for at least 12 years. He mixes hip hop pornographic and Biblical references in his multi-layered and detailed work which incorporates balls of elephant dung in every painting.    If they are not stuck to the canvas the lacquered fist-sized balls support each painting's lower edge as they are propped on the floor.    The Turner Prize open to British artists under 50 exhibiting during the previous 12 months carries a 20000 pound dlrs 33000 cash award.    This year's other short-listed artists were all female  sculptor Cathy de Monchaux and video installation artists Tacita Dean and Sam Taylor-Wood.    Although short lists invariably include a painter the prize has more often been won by sculptors or conceptual artists including Rachel Whiteread's inside-out room 1993 Anish Kapoor's organic shapes 1991 and Damien Hirst's pickled cows 1995.    The previous two years had been triumphs for video artists Gillian Wearing ``police officers'' posing for 20 minutes 1997 and Douglas Gordon two hands fighting 1996.

<HTML>    BRUSSELS Belgium AP  France's oil giant Total SA took over the Belgian petrochemicals company Petrofina SA to create the sixth-largest oil company in the world and the third-largest in Europe the companies announced Tuesday.    The new company known as Total Fina will be quoted on the Paris Brussels New York and London stock exchanges a Petrofina statement said. The move was the latest in a series of mergers affecting the global oil market.    ``The combination of Total and Petrofina will allow the new entity to capture substantial productivity gains particularly in the North Sea and to expand its positions in the deep offshore United States Angola'' Petrofina said in a statement.    The market capitalization of both companies combined stood at 1391 billion Belgian francs dlrs 39.9 billion.    Petrofina's stock stood at 14250 francs dlrs 407.9 Friday before it was suspended for Monday's trading. The deal put the value at 19.482 francs dlrs 557.7 a jump in value of more than a third.    The agreement is based on a stock swap that provides nine Total Fina shares for two Petrofina shares. Total Fina will have a controlling stake in 41 percent of Petrofina which specializes in refinery.    ``In refining-marketing Total Fina will hold solid positions'' in the European Union. ``Joint management of the refineries and the marketing networks should yield substantial productivity gains'' the statement said.    A combined general meeting of shareholders has been called for Jan. 14 to approve the agreement. Total said a public offering on the remaining Petrofina shares will follow.    The move made Belgian investor Albert Frere who controlled 30 percent of Petrofina shares the biggest shareholder of Total Fina.    Petrofina stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors that the company was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA Total SA and Italy's ENI SpA.    Petrofina which employs 15000 people worldwide is one of Belgium's biggest industrial companies. It has interests in other enterprises including energy company Electrabel utilities company Tractebel SA and holding companies Companie National a Portefeuille Sidro Sofina SA Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA and Electrafina SA.

<HTML>    CAIRO Egypt AP  An Egyptian human rights activist was ordered jailed Tuesday for 15 days pending a probe into allegations that he took money from Britain in return for writing a report about police brutality.    Police are investigating Hafez Abu Saada the secretary general of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights for ``accepting donations without prior government consent'' an EOHR spokesman said.    The police also are working on the premise that Saada published ``false reports that harm national interests and accepted money transfers from foreign countries aimed at acts that harm national and security interests'' said the spokesman Yasser Abdul-Razzak.    The charges are punishable by up to 15 years in jail.    Prosecutor-general Raga el-Araby who used his constitutional authority to order Saada's detention will put him on trial if the police find enough evidence within the next 15 days.    The EOHR admits accepting in October a dlrs 25000 donation by the British Parliament's human rights committee. But it denies the money influenced its report on the arrest and alleged torture of scores of Coptic Christians in the southern village of el-Kusheh in August.    On Tuesday the EOHR's 15-member board decided to return the money to Britain and to reject in future all foreign donations as a demonstration of its neutrality.    The donation became controversial after it was reported on Nov. 23 by an Egyptian weekly Al-Osboa which called it a payment for committing treason. Two days later the prosecutor-general took up the case.    EOHR's report on el-Kusheh says police while investigating a murder of two Coptic Christians in the village rounded up hundreds of Copts and beat them in a bid to extract false confessions.    The report said police feared the culprits were Muslim and were anxious to pin the blame on Christians to prevent religious strife in the Christian majority town.    During interviews with The Associated Press many villagers confirmed they were tortured.    The government has denied widespread torture and says only 14 people were detained. The Interior Ministry says foreign-funded rights groups are maligning Egypt.    Al-Osboa whose editor is believed to have close links with the Interior Ministry called the EOHR report a ``flagrant conspiracy on Egyptian national security.''  UR; my/vj

<HTML>    BERN Switzerland AP  Four years of tough negotiations were concluded early Tuesday with a transport deal between the European Union and Switzerland clearing the way to a wider agreement covering areas like air transport and labor.    The deal obliges the Swiss  who long held out for environmental reasons  to raise the weight limit on trucks to 40 tons from 28 tons by the year 2005.    In return they will levy a tax of at least 325 Swiss francs dlrs 230 on trucks transiting through the Alpine nation. This will be used to help fund two rail tunnels intended to take the pressure off the roads.    Switzerland is not a member of the 15-nation EU but is surrounded by members Germany France Italy and Austria. Its tight restrictions on foreign trucks have for years infuriated neighboring countries because of the inconvenience of compliance and the cost of detours.    After an all-night bargaining session with Swiss Transport Minister Moritz Leuenberger EU ministers gave their blessing to the transport agreement early Tuesday. Under the compromise deal Switzerland is allowed to keep its controversial night-time ban.    The Swiss government and business representatives hailed the agreement.    Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti said he hoped that a wider package of bilateral agreements could now be wrapped up. In particular Switzerland hopes that its concessions on trucks will persuade the EU to give national flag carrier Swissair better access to European airports.    The dossier is due to be discussed at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers next Monday. However with the EU preoccupied with its own plans for monetary union and eastward expansion the Swiss dossier is low on the list of priorities.    In 1992 Swiss voters rejected plans to join a loose European free trade agreement . This forced the government into painstaking sectoral negotiations with Brussels to gain the access it needs to crucial export markets.

<HTML>    GAZA CITY Gaza Strip AP  Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority on Tuesday disputed a published report asserting it had spent money earmarked for low-income housing on luxury apartments for wealthy Arafat associates.    ``I don't see any corruption in housing'' Palestinian Housing Minister Abdel Rahman Hamad said in response to a report in the Sunday Times of London.    The report came a day before a Washington conference of international donors at which more than 43 nations pledged a total of more than dlrs 3 billion in aid to the Palestinians.    Palestinian officials feared the allegations coupled with previous findings of corruption would dampen enthusiasm for providing aid.    At a news conference the Palestinian housing minister said low-income Palestinians were indeed the chief beneficiaries of subsidized housing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.    He said 90 percent of the buyers of 922 European Union-funded housing units in Gaza had incomes of less than dlrs 600 a month.    He acknowledged that buyers did include some Arafat associates who returned from exile with the start of Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip.    But he said the application process for purchasing the units had been open to all and that apartment sales were carried out under joint EU supervision.    Hamad also called the newspaper's description of luxury features at some of the EU-funded apartments unfair. He said the units were built according to simple basic specifications and that extras like satellite dishes and custom-styling came at the expense of individual owners.    The report also suggested that the units were unusually spacious but the housing minister said their size  90 to 100 square meters  was normal for Palestinian families which tend to be large.    Of those living in housing built with European Union backing in Gaza Hamad said 136 were unemployed 193 worked in the private sector 55 were employed by non-governmental organizations 48 worked for the United Nations 189 worked for civilian ministries in the Palestinian Authority and 301 were employed by the Palestinian security forces.    At the donor conference U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said disbursement of American funds would be closely monitored. Hamad said the Palestinians welcomed the scrutiny.    ``We don't want donors to use this worry over corruption as an excuse not to provide aid'' he said.

<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  A Russian helicopter swooped down through a blizzard in the dim light of the brief Arctic day Tuesday to rescue a TV crew that had been stranded for weeks on a remote island by bad weather.    The helicopter evacuated the three-man crew which included a Russian a Japanese and an Australian who had been making a documentary on polar bears. The crew was airlifted from Wrangel Island to the port of Pevek the Ministry of Emergency Situations said.    ``It wasn't easy to find pilots'' said Dean Finlay of the international emergency company AEA International SOS. ``Also there was only a three hour daytime window in the area and just over two hours of flight time so they had to get the window just right.''    The rescue helicopter had lifted off from Pevek at 11:30 a.m. local time 1130 Monday GMT  the height of the Arctic day that never gets brighter than twilight.    The temperature on Wrangle Island has been around minus 30 Celsius minus 22 Fahrenheit with unusually bad weather.    ``We were filming polar bears and other animals'' the Russian member of the team Nikita Ovsyannikov told Russian television channel NTV. ``On Oct. 15 we completed the work and a flight was ordered to take us back.''    ``But this year the weather conditions were very unusual: heavy long cyclones the weather was constantly bad with powerful blizzards. So the flight couldn't arrive.''    The Japanese crew member Tatsuhiko Kobayashi developed complications from a recent eye operation but the others were in good health Russia's ORT television reported.    There were conflicting reports on who organized the rescue. Emergency Situations Ministry spokesman Viktor Beltsov said the rescue was organized by his agency using an Mi-8 helicopter hired from a private airline.    But AEA International SOS said it had organized the rescue according to Mark Crawford the company's spokesman in Australia.    ``They're in fair spirits'' Crawford said of the crew. ``They're surviving of course but they were down to their last three days of food.''    Crawford said his company had been hired to conduct the rescue by the filmmakers' employer Natural History Pty. Ltd. in New Zealand.    The film crew arrived on Wrangel Island on Sept. 2 and intended to leave Oct. 15 but were delayed by bad weather. The weather also prevented the Emergency Situations Ministry from sending a rescue helicopter.    The three were holed up in a cabin on the island's northeast coast about 550 kilometers 350 miles west of Alaska.    Their food supplies were running out raising concerns about the men. Residents of a village about 130 kilometers 80 miles from the hut attempted to take emergency supplies to the crew but were defeated by bad weather.    Emergency officials earlier offered to try to rescue the crew by snow tractor but the three reportedly turned down the offer because they would have been forced to leave most of their equipment behind ORT television reported.    Kobayashi is an employee of NHK the Japanese television company. The Australian is cameraman John McGuiness.    pvs/ad/ren
