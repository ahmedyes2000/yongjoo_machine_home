<HTML>    MILAN Italy AP  Italy will start the same trio of players who upset the United States when it takes on defending champion Sweden in the Dec. 4-6 Davis Cup final at Assago Forum.    Italian captain Paolo Bertolucci announced Tuesday that Andrea Gaudenzi and Davide Sanguinetti will play the singles with Diego Nargiso teaming with Gaudenzi in the doubles.    Gianluca Pozzi will be the reserve player.    ``You can't change a winning team'' said Bartolucci.    Italy's No.1 player Gaudenzi Sanguinetti and Nargiso led a 4-1 rout of the United States in the Davis Cup semifinals at Milwaukee.    Meanwhile Thomas Johansson who's nursing a strained right knee may become a last-minute starter on the Swedish side in the three-day final on clay in an indoor sports palace at the Milan outskirts.    Johansson initially dropped from the Swedish team because of the sore knee and his questionable efficiency on clay trained at the Forum this week showing good form and determination.    Johansson may replace Magnus Norman on Sweden's quartet.    Swedish captain Carl-Axel Hageskog said he will announce the team on Thursday  the day of the official draw in Milan  and declined to comment on Johansson's chances to play the final.    Johansson is the highest-ranked Swedish player in the ATP computer lists 17th.    Sweden enters the final as favorite to clinch its seventh title - the third in four years.    However Hageskog noted Italy may take advantage from playing on clay.    ``Otherwise I'm not worried with the home crowd. My players are able to negotiate every situation'' he said.    The opening day singles on Friday begin at 1330gmt.  UR; pv
