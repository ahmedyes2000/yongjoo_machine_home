<HTML>    LONDON AP  Selling pressure on world markets in recent days has pushed down the average wholesale cost of cocoa to its lowest level for nearly a year and a half.    The International Cocoa Organization's latest daily cocoa market indicator price fell to dlrs 1550.23 939.53 pounds per metric ton Tuesday  a level last seen in June 1997.
