<HTML>    LONDON AP  English golfer Lee Westwood denies claims he dented and damaged his replica of the Australian Open trophy.    Colin Phillips executive director of the Australian Golf Union said the trophy had to be repaired by a Melbourne jeweler at a cost of 8500 pounds dlrs 14000.    Phillips said the cup was broken at the base and had dents in the top when officials opened its velvet-lined shipping box.    Westwood is not defending his Australian title this week opting for the Million Dollar Challenge in Sun City South Africa.    ``The trophy was returned on 21st September and duly signed for by the Australian Golf Union as being received in perfect condition'' Westwood said Tuesday from South Africa.    ``I am surprised that two days prior to the Million Dollar Challenge and the Australian Open they have decided to air their grievances.''    Australian officials are apparently upset about Westwood's withdrawal from the Australian Open and claim they got the news secondhand a charge Westwood also denied.    ``I withdrew on Sept. 2 explaining I had been invited to play in the Million Dollar Challenge with the world's top 12 golfers'' he said.    Westwood was criticized early this year for withdrawing on short notice from the Western Open in Chicago  the week after the U.S. Open. He also pulled out of the MCI Classic in South Carolina the week after the U.S. Masters.    In Sun City Westwood is trying to finish his season with a third successive victory having won twice last month in Japan.    scw
