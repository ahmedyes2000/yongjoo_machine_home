<HTML>    TEGUCIGALPA Honduras AP  Honduras announced Tuesday that it suspended a governor for inflating her region's death toll from Hurricane Mitch and lowered its official death count by 1350 people.    The new death toll of 5657 was compiled after the government sent teams to verify reports from regions across Honduras the Interior Secretariat said Tuesday.    The governor Lucila Esperanza Barahona de Castro of the Santa Barbara region in remote northwestern Honduras was suspended after investigators could verify only 282 of the 1159 deaths reported in her area.    Authorities said the suspension was standard procedure during an inquiry.    Barahona told The Associated Press she couldn't have falsified the numbers because she didn't even give a death toll to the federal government.    ``I don't know what source gave them the numbers'' she said Tuesday.    In addition to the 5657 dead Honduras said it had verified 8058 missing 12272 injured and 1.4 million homeless throughout the country.
