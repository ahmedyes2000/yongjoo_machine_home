<HTML>    KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia AP  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday dared his detractors to form a political party and challenge him in a general election.    ``If they want to set up a political party its okay if they dare'' Mahathir told local reporters.    The Malaysian leader said authorities would approve the formation of a new political party if it eschewed street protests and promised not to hold demonstrations.    ``But if they say they want to form a political party because they want to shoot and kill people and hold demonstrations every day we will not give the approval'' Bernama news agency quoted him as saying after he inaugurated a new Malaysia-made small aircraft.    Supporters of jailed former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim have gathered repeatedly in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur in recent weeks to hold mostly peaceful anti-government demonstrations.    Anwar's supporters have shouted slogans demanding an end to Mahathir's 17-year rule and burned portraits of the prime minister.    Police in the Southeast Asian country have responded by using water cannons to disperse the crowds and arresting hundreds of anti-government activists.    Mahathir suggested that Anwar's supporters form an electoral party rather than organize protests that disrupt traffic and local commerce.    But a general election is not scheduled until 2000.    ``In the election they can contest they can also curse ...I am used to being cursed by them so it does not make much of a difference to me'' he said.    Mahathir fired his Anwar his former protege on Sept. 2 alleging that he was too immoral to rule. Anwar was subsequently arrested and is facing trial on 10 counts of abuse of office and illegal sex.    He has denied all the charges against him saying they were politically motivated.
