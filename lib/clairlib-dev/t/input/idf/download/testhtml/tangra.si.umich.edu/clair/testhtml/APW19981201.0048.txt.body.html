<HTML>    UNITED NATIONS AP  The U.N. General Assembly demanded full implementation of the Bosnia peace agreement and called on all parties to hand over all those indicted for war crimes to an international tribunal.    Without a vote the assembly on Monday adopted a resolution which underlined that international assistance for Bosnia remains conditional on strict compliance with the Dayton peace agreement and subsequent obligations including cooperation with the tribunal.    The tribunal at The Hague in the Netherlands was set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1993. At least 20 war crimes suspects remain at large in Bosnia including the wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Gen. Ratko Mladic.    While Russia supports the international tribunal Moscow's Deputy Ambassador Yuriy Fedotov said his government opposed any military or police actions to capture suspected war criminals.    He noted that the Dayton accord and the tribunal's statutes clearly stated that any extradition should be carried out exclusively on the basis of cooperation.    The assembly resolution also encouraged all parties to accelerate the peaceful and orderly return of refugees and internally displaced persons to all areas of the country including those where they would be an ethnic minority.    The resolution which is not legally binding condemned all acts of intimidation violence and killings including acts designed to discourage the return of refugees. It demanded that such acts be investigated and prosecuted.    Austrian Ambassador Ernst Sucharipa speaking on behalf of the European Union said there was no alternative to the 1995 Dayton agreement.    The holding of free and fair elections in September was only an initial step in the construction of a democratic society he said urging Muslims Croats and Serbs to cooperate to implement the election results.    The reform of the judicial system and the restructuring of the civilian police were crucial to the establishment of the rule of law Sucharipa said.    Saying the current level of international support could not be maintained indefinitely Russia's Fedotov called on all parties to confirm their willingness to implement the Dayton agreement and achieve genuine inter-ethnic reconciliation.    Bosnia's Ambassador Mohammed Sacirbey called for continued support for judicial and police reforms ``especially where local authorities may be resistant to or not reflect the commitment to pluralism.''    He also expressed dismay at the failure of Yugoslavia ``to establish diplomatic relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina without precondition.''
