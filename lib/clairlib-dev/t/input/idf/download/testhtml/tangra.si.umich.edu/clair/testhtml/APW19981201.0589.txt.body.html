<HTML>    BEIJING AP  China on Tuesday called for the immediate release of 20 Chinese fishermen arrested by a Philippine navy patrol near the disputed Spratly Islands.    The Chinese government is very concerned views the detentions as illegal and wants Manila to take measures to avoid such arrests in the future Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said at a twice-weekly briefing.    The Philippine patrol arrested 20 Chinese fishermen and seized their six boats on Sunday near the Alicia Annie Reef which is claimed by both the Philippines and China.    A Philippine navy officer Maj. Romulo Gualdrapa said Monday they were arrested for illegally fishing in Philippine territory and using sodium cyanide to catch fish in violation of a Philippine law that bans the practice.    Cyanide is added to sea water by some fishermen to stun fish so they can be caught and sold alive to restaurants. Cyanide kills many other fish and destroys coral reefs.    In Manila Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the Chinese fishermen's mother ship refused to stop and headed for the Mischief Reef part of the Spratly Islands.    ``So it appears that Mischief Reef is now becoming a haven of these illegal fishermen'' Mercado said.    Presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the Chinese fishermen will be released.    ``They will be detained for a short period. They will lectured to about not violating the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines and then after an appropriate time they will be let off'' he said.    The arrests were the latest in a series of recent incidents between Manila and Beijing over territories in the South China Sea.    The Spratlys are believed to be rich in oil gas and minerals. China Vietnam and Taiwan claim all of the Spratlys while the Philippines Malaysia and Brunei claim parts of the chain.
