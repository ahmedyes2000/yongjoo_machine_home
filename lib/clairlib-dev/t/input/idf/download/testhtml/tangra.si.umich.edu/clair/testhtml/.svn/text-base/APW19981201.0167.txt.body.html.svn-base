<HTML>    BANGKOK Thailand AP  Inauguration of the main media center for the 13th Asian Games was postponed Tuesday because the facilities weren't ready the latest blow to the hopes of host country Thailand that everything will run smoothly.    Five days before Asia's biggest sporting competition officially opens bugs are turning up  literally  in a last-minute frenzy to put the finishing touches on venues and in some cases make them usable.    The Bangkok Post highlighted problems both about the poor soccer pitch at the National Stadium where the main matches will be played and the central swimming pool's tendency to fill up with dead insects.    Taiwan's riding team at the equestrian center meanwhile blamed poor arena conditions for injuries to a prize horse. And a surprise rainstorm threatened to soak Tuesday's final rehearsal for the opening ceremonies.    Nearly 5000 journalists have been accredited to cover the games which will bring together some 6000 athletes from 41 countries in what the organizers have billed as the 20th century's last great sporting event.    But the organization and construction of the venues has been plagued by the Asian economic crisis.    The main media center already a week behind schedule for its inauguration saw the official opening postponed again Tuesday when Jurin Laksanavisit a government minister didn't show because the facilities weren't ready.    ``I'm still trying to get the center officially opened today'' said Santiparb Tejavanija deputy secretary general of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee. ``It's already behind schedule. Now they want to postpone until Dec. 3. That will be too late.''    The pitch at the Bangkok's National Stadium where Oman demolished Hong Kong 6-0 in Monday's preliminary soccer matches which unofficially kicked off the competition is far below the required international standard the Bangkok Post cited Asia's top soccer official as saying.    Dato Peter Velappan secretary general of the Asian Football Confederation said that the pitch needed to be upgraded immediately or another ground would have to be found for remaining matches.    Velappan said he had warned Thailand six months ago that the pitch was not good enough. Attempts to improve it made matters worse because the contractor who laid new turf had more experience with home gardens than soccer grounds the Post said.    Just days ago parts of the pitch were covered in water and bare patches were showing.    Meanwhile the head of the Swimming Association of Thailand was quoted in the same newspaper as saying that thousands of dead insects of all kinds have been found floating in the central competition pool.    ``For Thai men it might not be a serious problem but I am sure it would make the foreigners' hair stand on end'' Maj. Gen. Kamol Saen-issara said.    Games officials with the help of the Public Health Department have tried to solve the problem to no avail. Kamol said organizers might have to turn to strong insecticides but vowed not to use any substances that could harm swimmers.    Kamol said he hoped that when the pool is in use the increased presence of humans might keep the bugs away. But since they tend to come at night attracted from swampy nearby fields to the bright lights more help might be needed.
