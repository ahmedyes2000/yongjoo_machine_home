<HTML>    KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia AP  A key police witness in the Anwar Ibrahim trial told the court Tuesday that he had failed to win business favors from the ex-deputy prime minister but denied that led him to testify against the defendant.    The former police intelligence officer Amir Junos faced questioning from defense attorneys about whether he was biased against Anwar because his request for favors had been denied.    Earlier the witness had admitted during cross-examination that he had asked Anwar for equity in a securities firm and business deals for his friends.    ``I was not given anything. I merely tried to express my feeling to get a portion of the equity but I did not get anything'' Amir told the court.    Defense lawyer Christopher Fernando suggested Amir might bear a grudge after having failed to get the equity stake in the brokerage.    ``I do not have such intentions'' Amir replied.    Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 two weeks after he was fired as deputy prime minister and finance minister.    His subsequent jailing and beating while in custody has attracted international concern over the case including governments from the 15-member European Union.    ``The EU is concerned that the Malaysian authorities have still not published the results of the investigations on the beating and urges them to do so as soon as possible'' the European Union said in a statement made available Tuesday.    Anwar is being tried on four counts of corruption. He will be tried on another corruption count as well as five counts of sexual misconduct at a later date.    Anwar who was also finance minister denies the charges calling them part of political vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.    Amir was called as a witness by the prosecution to prove allegations that Anwar had directed the police to obtain retractions from two people who accused Anwar of having sex with his secretary's wife and sodomizing his chauffeur.    On Tuesday Amir conceded under cross-examination that it was wrong for police to have used scare tactics to obtain retractions from Ummi Hafilda Ali and Azizan Abu Bakar.    ``What Anwar asked you to do was it wrong or improper?'' asked defense attorney Gurbachan Singh.    ``I think it is wrong'' Amir said.    ``Are you then admitting that what you did was wrong and improper?'' Gurbachan pressed on.    After a long pause Amir quietly said: ``It was wrong. What I did was wrong.''    Amir also acknowledged that Anwar didn't order police to obtain retractions from Ummi and Azizan using the ``turning over'' operation a method of interrogation that includes sleep deprivation and physical threats.    However he maintained that Anwar abused his power as deputy prime minister coercing police officers to carry out his desires without issuing specific orders.    The trial now in its fourth week has been buffeted by chaos including the sentencing on Monday of a defense lawyer to a three-month jail sentence for contempt of court.    Judge Augustine Paul handed down the sentence Monday after Zainur Zakaria refused to apologize for an affidavit he had filed on behalf of Anwar seeking the removal of two prosecutors on grounds that they were fabricating evidence.    The lawyer who won a reprieve from a higher court until his appeal hearing Friday was present in the court Tuesday.    Amir the chief witness on Tuesday also denied warning Anwar about ``political enemies'' or telling the former No. 2 that his phone had been tapped since 1992.    Defense lawyer Fernando asked Amir if he had warned Anwar that trade minister Rafidah Aziz and former chief minister of Malacca state Abdul Rahim Thamby Chik were his enemies because he had recommended that they face corruption charges.    ``I disagree that I had identified by name several of Anwar's enemies'' Amir said.
