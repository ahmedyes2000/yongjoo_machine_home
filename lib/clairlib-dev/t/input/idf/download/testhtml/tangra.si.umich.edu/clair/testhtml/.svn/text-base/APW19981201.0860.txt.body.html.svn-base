<HTML>    LONDON AP  England full-back Matt Perry has been ruled out of Saturday's rugby union Test against South Africa at Twickenham.    Perry suffered a concussion during last weekend's defeat against Australia and will be sidelined for three weeks England coach Clive Woodward said Tuesday.    With Paul Grayson and Will Greenwood still questionable with injuries Woodward called up David Rees and Alex King into the squad to provide cover at wing and fly-half.    Perry was injured in the final seconds of the 12-11 defeat against the Wallabies at Twickenham. Doctors said he should take off at least three weeks.    Grayson who limped off with a knee injury against the Aussies and center Greenwood who failed to make the match are still under treatment.    Woodward drafted King into his squad as stand-by for Grayson. Rees is likely to take Austin Healey's place in the wing.    Woodward did not call up an immediate replacement for Perry. It's expected that Mike Catt Grayson's replacement at fly-half against Australia will fill the full-back role.    The South Africa Springboks will set a world record of 18 consecutive Test victories if they beat England on Saturday. They would eclipse the New Zealand All Blacks' 17-match winning streak between 1965 and 1969.    ``I don't see any country going through a winning run of 17 or 18 Tests in the future'' Springboks coach Nick Mallett said.    sw
