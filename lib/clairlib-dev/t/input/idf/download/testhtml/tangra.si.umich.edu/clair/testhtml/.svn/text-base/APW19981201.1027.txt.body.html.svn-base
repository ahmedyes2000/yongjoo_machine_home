<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  With a dlrs 22.6 billion loan for Russia hanging in limbo International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus launched a new round of talks in Moscow on Tuesday on freeing up the money.    Yet Russia's government continued to put off tough financial decisions the IMF says are necessary for releasing the rest of the frozen loan and Camdessus was not expected to announce any breakthroughs.    Camdessus met Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Tuesday night and is scheduled to hold broader talks with government officials Wednesday.    ``I want to get better acquainted with the prime minister'' Camdessus told reporters upon arrival Tuesday night. ``I presume we will be having interesting conversations.''    Russia facing mounting debts to workers pensioners and foreign creditors is seeking further installments on a dlrs 22.6 billion IMF-led bailout package reached in the summer. The loan was frozen after Russia succumbed to the Asian economic crisis and devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August.    Russia has so far received only about dlrs 5 billion of the bailout package which also involves the World Bank and the Japanese government.    The IMF has said the government must come up with a realistic recovery plan before more money will be released.    An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer subsidies to ailing industries.    If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon it will probably have to start printing money which would drive up inflation.    ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid hyperinflation'' Oleg Sysuyev a top presidential aide told a news conference Tuesday.    The government has been delaying a debate on next year's budget as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet its expenses. The Cabinet again postponed the discussion this week but insisted the delay was not connected with Camdessus' visit.    However Russian media have suggested the government put off action on the budget because it is still hoping for the IMF loans. The latest draft assumes Russia will receive the IMF money.    ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague and their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit'' the business daily Kommersant said Tuesday.    Sysuyev meanwhile reiterated that President Boris Yeltsin will leave day-to-day management of economic matters to Primakov.    ``The new reality is that these matters are now dealt with by the government'' he said.    Yeltsin who is in the hospital receiving treatment for pneumonia discussed with Primakov by telephone Tuesday the government's stance at the talks with Camdessus.    adc
