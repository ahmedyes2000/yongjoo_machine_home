<HTML>    BUCHAREST Romania AP  In a giant military parade which cost this impoverished country a fortune Romania on Tuesday celebrated 80 years since it was reunited with Transylvania.    In freezing weather some 20000 people and military troops gathered outside the giant palace built by former communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in celebrations with a distinctly military feel.    But the festivities designed to give the country a boost were marred by splits among Romania's political parties and criticism that 3 billion lei dlrs 300000 spent to mark the day was breaking the impoverished country's budget.    The average monthly wage in Romania is 1.2 million lei dlrs 120.    The nationalist opposition boycotted the celebrations in the capital and traveled to Alba Iulia in Transylvania where the original reunification took place in 1918.    Romania was awarded Transylvania and the northern region of Bukovina as part of the spoils of World War I. British-born Queen Marie fought Romania's case to regain lost territory.    In Bucharest President Emil Constantinescu flanked by the head of the Orthodox Church took off his fur hat as the temperature hovered at -4 C 25F in respect for the military parade of 4000 soldiers. Priests officiated a service and the ceremony was broadcast live on state-run and private television.    ``This celebration will have a positive impact on the young people in the army'' said Lt. Col. Ion Petrescu as Puma helicopters and Hercules airplanes buzzed overhead.    For the past week helicopters and airplanes practicing for the ceremony have flown low over the capital and tanks have rolled past Ceausescu's palace which now houses the parliament.
