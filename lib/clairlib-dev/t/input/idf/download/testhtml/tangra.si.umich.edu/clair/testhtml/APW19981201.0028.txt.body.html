<HTML>    ISLAMABAD Pakistan AP  Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto warned Tuesday that Pakistan was moving toward a judicial system like the one in neighboring Afghanistan.    There the ruling Taliban militia amputate the limbs of thieves publicly execute murderers and beat people convicted of lesser crimes.    In a letter to international human rights groups as well as several heads of state including British Prime Minister Tony Blair Ms. Bhutto warned that ``Sharif's regime is intent to impose a Taliban-like system of justice within Pakistan.''    Ms. Bhutto has been a vocal opponent of Sharif's attempts to pass a constitutional amendment to bring Islamic rule to Pakistan.    The amendment already has been approved by Pakistan's powerful lawmaking Lower House of Parliament where Sharif has a comfortable majority.    However it needs to be passed by the Senate before becoming law and it seems certain to be defeated.    But several lawmakers say that won't be the end of it rather they warned that they will demand a nationwide referendum if the Senate defeats the amendment. Human rights groups worry a referendum would be so vaguely worded as to be impossible to defeat.    Ms. Bhutto's opposition to the proposed law has brought her under heavy criticism from the country's right wing religious politicians some of whom have accused her of betraying Islam.    Ms. Bhutto warned that the rights of minorities and women in Pakistan would be severely curtailed under Sharif's new Islamic law a charge his government has vehemently denied.    In her letter Ms. Bhutto asked world leaders ``to send a strong message to the Sharif regime that the Taliban system of justice is as unacceptable to the international community in Pakistan as it is in Afghanistan.''    The Taliban army rules about 90 percent of Afghanistan where it's brand of Islamic law has been imposed. As well as the punishments the Taliban have forced women off the job and girls out of school except to study the Muslim holy book The Koran. Men have been ordered to wear beards and women to wear the all-enveloping burqa which covers them from head to toe.
