<HTML>    LONDON AP  Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet left a north London psychiatric hospital Tuesday driven away to an undisclosed destination in an ambulance in a covoy headed by police vehicles.    The ambulance swept through the gates of Grovelands Priory a day after the hospital announced that the 83-year-old general did not need medical care and demanded that he leave.    The move by the hospital where Pinochet has been since Oct. 29 dealt a blow to any plan he had to plead he is too ill to be extradited to Spain to stand trial on charges of genocide and torture.
