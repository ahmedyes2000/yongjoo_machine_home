<HTML>    MONTREAL AP  Quebec's pro-independence government was re-elected but won only about 43 percent of the popular vote likely dampening its zest for holding a secession referendum any time soon.    The outcome of Monday's vote means a new term of up to five years for Quebec's charismatic premier Lucien Bouchard who says he will call a referendum on independence whenever he feels the separatist side can win.    But he may need to wait a while for what he calls the ``winning conditions.'' His Parti Quebecois retained its big majority in the legislature but was narrowly outpolled in the popular vote by its anti-separatist rival the Quebec Liberal Party.    With almost all 23000 polling stations reporting late Monday the separatists had 42.7 percent of the votes to 43.7 percent for the Liberals and 12 percent for a third party Democratic Action.    But despite the close popular vote the Liberals lagged far behind in the individual races for seats in the legislature because their support was heavily concentrated in a few areas of the province. The Parti Quebecois ran well among French-speakers in most areas of the province.    The separatists were on track to win 75 of the legislature's 125 seats the Liberals 48 and Democratic Action one with one seat to be filled later because the separatist candidate recently died.    The outcome was a virtual replay of 1994 when the separatists won 77 seats to 47 for the Liberals while each receiving about 44 percent of the popular vote.    Bouchard in his victory speech paid tribute to his opponents and pledged to work with them on policy matters. But he also promised to work for the ``winning conditions'' that would make independence possible.    ``Our first priority is to advance Quebec ... to push it farther toward its destiny'' he said.    Bouchard's main rival was Liberal party leader Jean Charest who tried to convince voters that the province would prosper only if the decades-old threat of secession was abandoned.    Charest 40 became an early favorite when he quit federal politics in March to enter the Quebec race; in English-speaking Canada he was viewed as the potential savior of national unity.    He then dropped behind in the polls and appeared relieved by his party's strong showing in the popular vote.    ``The result tonight ... reflects the fact that the people of Quebec like the people of all Canada want this country of ours to work and be a success'' he told supporters in his home district of Sherbrooke.    Charest confirmed that would stay on as Liberal leader in the legislature.    Bouchard 59 has maintained high popularity ratings despite overseeing painful spending cuts over the past three years in a drive to erase Quebec's deficit. Among Francophones he has never lost the mythic aura he gained when after losing a leg and almost dying from a flesh-eating disease in 1994 he came back to lead the separatists to near-victory in a 1995 referendum on secession.    Though Bouchard has served in the federal Cabinet and federal Parliament this was the first time he ever ran as a party leader in Quebec. He was appointed premier without an election in 1996 after his predecessor Jacques Parizeau resigned following the 1995 referendum.    There were 5.2 million eligible voters Monday and turnout was more than 80 percent even though this was the fourth province-wide vote in the past five years.    Analysts had suggested that a landslide separatist victory  approaching 50 percent of the popular vote  would lead to pressure from Parti Quebecois militants to hold a secession referendum quickly. Monday's results were considered more likely to prompt a cautious approach from Bouchard and perhaps a wait of a year or two before considering a referendum.    The separatists have lost secession referendums twice before once by a big margin in 1980 and just narrowly in 1995.    Bouchard anxious to avoid a third defeat said he would call another referendum only when he was convinced the separatists would win. In the meantime he says he would seek more autonomy for all 10 provinces particularly in regard to control over social programs.    Many Quebeckers supported Bouchard even though they oppose secession. Polls suggest only about 43 percent of Quebec voters would support independence now and about two-thirds do not want a referendum on secession in the next few years.    To woo these voters Bouchard tried to portray the election as the choice of the most competent leadership with the thorny question of a referendum to be addressed at a later date.    The Liberals' chances clearly were hurt by the relatively strong showing of Democratic Action whose leader 28-year-old Mario Dumont retained his seat in the legislature. His party which appeals to many young voters favors greater autonomy for Quebec but stops short of advocating outright secession.    About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from southern Europe Asia and elsewhere.    The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is different from the rest of Canada plus a yearning to manage their own affairs and have their own national symbols.
