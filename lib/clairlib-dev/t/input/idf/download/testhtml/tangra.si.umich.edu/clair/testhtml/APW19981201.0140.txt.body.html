<HTML>    NAIROBI Kenya AP  Sudanese rebels said Tuesday they fought off a four-pronged government attack in the Nuba Mountains in western central Sudan.    Government ground forces attacked the region on Nov. 11 and were finally driven out on Nov. 23 said Martin Okerruk spokesman for the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army in Nairobi.    Sudanese opposition radio said SPLA troops killed 42 government soldiers wounded many others and took four prisoners. Two rebel soldiers were killed and eight wounded it said.    Okerruk said he could not confirm the casualty figures because he was still waiting for details from the field.    Animist and Christian rebels in southern Sudan have fought a 15-year insurgency for autonomy from the Arab Muslim-dominated government in the north. More than 1.5 million Sudanese have died in the fighting and consequent famines.    kjd
