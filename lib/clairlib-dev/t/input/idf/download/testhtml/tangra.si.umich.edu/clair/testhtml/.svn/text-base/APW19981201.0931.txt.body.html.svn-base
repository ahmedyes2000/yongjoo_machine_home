<HTML>    HAVANA AP  Christmas in Cuba is back for good.    The Communist Party used the entire front page of Cuba's only daily newspaper Granma on Tuesday to recommend that ``from this year on'' Dec. 25 should be a holiday in Cuba formally re-establishing a custom abolished in 1969.    The proposal is sure to be adopted by the Communist country's government.    The Roman Catholic archbishop's office had no immediate reaction to the recommendation.    The government granted a Christmas holiday last year as a one-time favor to Pope John Paul II who visited in January. But at the time it balked at declaring the measure permanent.    Cuba abolished the Christmas holiday in 1969 saying it interfered with the mobilization of manpower for the sugar harvest.    The party declaration insisted that the abolition of the holiday was not inspired by any anti-religious sentiment.    However the government at the time was avowedly atheist and Christians were barred from being members of the Communist Party or of holding many sensitive jobs.    Christmas trees were strongly discouraged.    In recent years the government has declared itself secular rather than atheist has dropped restrictions on Christians and moved to improve ties with Cuba's churches and other religions.    Even state stores are selling plastic Christmas trees and ornaments this year.    In its statement the party praised churches for condemning the U.S. embargo of Cuba for sending aid and for speaking out in favor of social justice around the world.
