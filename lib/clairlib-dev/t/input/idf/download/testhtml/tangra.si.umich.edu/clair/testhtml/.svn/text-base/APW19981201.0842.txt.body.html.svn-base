<HTML>    HELSINKI Finland AP  Rudolph the real reindeer wasn't as eager to please as the one in the song causing havoc for a week in the outlying regions of the Finnish capital.    The six-year-old Rudolph was brought last month from central Finland to Sotunki outside Helsinki where he was to entertain children and give sled rides.    But on Nov. 22 he fled his enclosure apparently spooked by a galloping horse and plunged into the woods. Farmers reported several sightings and motorists sometimes had to swerve to avoid the renegade reindeer.    With the help of vigilant reindeer-spotters Rudolph was nabbed by his previous owner who came south and tracked him down the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper said Tuesday.    There are an estimated 200000 reindeer in Finland bred mainly by the Samis in Lapland northern Finland. They are tame unlike in neighboring Norway and Sweden where there are also herds of wild reindeer.    mhh-jh
