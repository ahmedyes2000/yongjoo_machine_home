<HTML>    THE HAGUE Netherlands AP  A genocide suspect who called himself the ``Serb Adolf'' seemed to enjoy murdering and torturing hundreds of Muslim prisoners of war a witness testified Tuesday at a U.N. trial.    Goran Jelisic a 30-year-old mechanic who has already confessed to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats is being tried for genocide the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's most severe charge. He committed the murders and beatings while working in a detention camp near the northern Bosnian town of Brcko in 1992.    ``I think he took pleasure in doing this because he was so powerful'' said a 53-year-old Muslim camp survivor identified only as Witness B. ``He said it was nice to kill.''    Witness B said he was taken to the Luka detention camp with two busloads of Muslims. He said Jelisic a Bosnian Serb immediately took all of their identification papers and personal belongings.    ``He introduced himself and said `My name is Goran Jelisic known as Adolf. You will get to know me well''' Witness B said on the second day of Jelisic's genocide trial.    Jelisic called out some of the names from the identification papers and said the people called would be executed then laughed and said he was only joking the witness testified.    He recounted how Jelisic interrogated two detainees who were not residents of Brcko. When they told him they were visiting relatives for May Day he accused them of lying Witness B said.    ``He said `This will by your last May Day' and took them out and killed them'' the witness said.    Earlier in the day another witness  also a Muslim  continued his testimony from Monday detailing how Jelisic allegedly brutally shot Muslims by holding their heads over a grate.    Jelisic and other camp guards tortured and killed people at will Witness A said calling Jelisic ``a beast.''    ``They simply knew we were Muslims and Croats. They simply wanted to eradicate us'' said Witness A who had to take a short break when he began to sob on the stand.    ``I think this was killing of pleasure out of some kind of hate against my people. Those of us that survived... we all believe he tried to inflict as much pain as possible'' he said.    During the testimony Jelisic sat calmly alternately leaning forward on the table in front of him or slumping in his chair.    By trying him for genocide U.N. prosecutors will be able to call evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders including the involvement of more senior Serbs.    Jelisic will be convicted of the 12 murders he confessed to and sentenced at the end of his trial which is expected to last well into 1999. He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for each offense.    Set up in 1993 by the U.N. Security Council the tribunal has convicted two Muslims two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder rape and torture but it has yet to register a genocide conviction.    km/bk
