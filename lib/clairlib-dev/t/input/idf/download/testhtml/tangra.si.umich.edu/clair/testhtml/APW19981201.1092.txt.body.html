<HTML>    TURIN Italy AP  Juventus general director Luciano Moggi on Tuesday defended as ``well grounded'' the club decision to travel to Istanbul on game day for the politically tinged European Champions League match against Galatasaray.    The Italian league champions who need a victory to keep its quarterfinal chances alive have decided to travel to Istanbul on Wednesday and return home immediately after the game.    UEFA Europe's governing body for soccer requires teams to arrive the day before of European Cup matches and was critical of Juventus' decision.    ``Juventus feels there are well grounded motives for failing to conform to UEFA directives'' Moggi sauid.    Juventus confirmed on Tuesday its travel plans for the match which was postponed by a week after anti-Italian demonstrations erupted in Turkey over Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader.    Several Juventus players who had initially refused to travel to Instanbul bowed to the club decision to play Galatasaray but criticized the UEFA stand.    ``We have been forced to play a game conditioned by political motives'' Juventus starting goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi said.    Team captain Antonio Conte said Tuesday that the Italian government and UEFA left the Italian team standing alone.    ``UEFA and the Italian government have claimed that there are no security problems in Istanbul ... but as far as we know no UEFA and government representatives will be in Istanbul Wednesday'' Conte told the Italian news agency ANSA.    Italian culture minister Giovanna Melandri who was invited to attend the game by her Turkish counterpart said Tuesday she had not yet decided whether to travel to Istanbul.
