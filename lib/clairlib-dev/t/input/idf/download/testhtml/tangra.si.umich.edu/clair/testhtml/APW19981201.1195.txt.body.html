<HTML>    LONDON AP  In an ambulance escorted by armed police in darkness former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet left hospital Tuesday for a luxury home on the edge of Wentworth golf course to continue his fight against extradition to Spain on charges of genocide and torture.    To shout and taunts of fist-shaking demonstrators Pinochet swept through the gates of Grovelands Priory a day after the psychiatric hospital announced that the 83-year-old general is fit does not need medical care and demanded that he leave.    With a police helicopter circling overhead the ambulance convoy arrived an hour later at the Wentworth Estate a compound of magnificent houses with private grounds many overlooking the fairways of the famed course 20 miles 30 kms west of London and home to the European golf tour.    There was no word on who owns the house in the estate's Lindale Close where Pinochet is staying. North Surrey police chief Carl Crathern confirmed that Pinochet ``is now in residence in a house on Wentworth estate.''    Supporters househunted while the Grovelands Priory became increasingly impatient and eventually precipitated Pinochet's departure by announcing there is nothing wrong with him.    The statement was a blow to any attempt by Pinochet to plead that he is too ill or frail to stand trial over deaths and torture of political opponents by secret police during his 1973-90 rule after he overthrew an elected Marxist.    Britain's Home Secretary Jack Straw must decided by Dec. 11 whether to let extradition proceedings start and if he does Pinochet will likely be in Britain through months of court battles. Straw could block extradition on several grounds including compassion.    ``He showed no compassion for us so why should we show any for him'' said Francina Ramirez 41 a Chilean exile outside the hospital who said she was arrested by Pinochet's secret police and tortured with electric currents passing through her breasts.    Pinochet's new neighbors mostly bankers and stockbrokers face similar scenes of demonstrations and a heavy police presence.    In the House of Commons Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett warned Britons to stay away from Chile unless it was essential to go there. He said Britons living there ``to keep a low profile avoid crowds meetings demonstrations and areas where the English-speaking community usually gathers.''    Chile's government stepped up efforts to get the Pinochet freed. In Spain Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said it was becoming increasingly likely Pinochet would be tried in Chile.    Although an official Chilean report says some 3000 people were murdered or tortured during Pinochet's rule the Chilean government wants him back  partly because of fears that the anger of his supporters will polarize the newly democratic society.    Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in a central London hospital where he had undergone back surgery. He moved Oct. 29 to Grovelands Priory which for more than two weeks has been trying to make him leave.    An National Opinion Poll published Tuesday indicated that 51 percent of Britons think Pinochet should be extradited 32 percent disagreed and the rest of the 961-strong sample of voters questioned had no opinion. The error margin was plus or minus three percent.    mj
