<HTML>    JAKARTA Indonesia AP - Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on Tuesday condemned religious attacks and urged restraint in the wake of mob rampages that have left churches and mosques in ruins in the Southeast Asian nation.    ``We condemn all burning of houses of God'' Habibie said at the opening of a human rights workshop at the state palace. ``We condemn it whether it is the burning of churches or mosques or Buddhist temples or whatever.''    On Monday Christian crowds in the provincial capital of Kupang burned or ransacked 15 mosques as well as a Muslim school and a hostel for Islamic pilgrims.    The violence apparently came in retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim mobs in Jakarta on Nov. 22 when 14 people were killed some hacked to death.    Habibie who is already beset by economic and political turmoil said the attacks violated the values of Indonesian culture.    Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the national philosophy known as Pancasila adopted when Indonesia declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.    ``We will not tolerate any kind of discrimination against ethnic groups religious discrimination or racial discrimination'' Habibie said. ``You should know that this is a basic principle of daily life.    ``Indonesia is not a secular state but also we are not a state based on one religion'' he said. ``We are a state reflecting the society based on a variety of religions.''    State Secretary Akbar Tanjung pledged that the government would help rebuild ruined churches and mosques.    Indonesia is the world's most populous Islamic nation. About 90 percent of its 202 million people are Muslims with the rest following Christian Hindu Buddhist or other faiths.
