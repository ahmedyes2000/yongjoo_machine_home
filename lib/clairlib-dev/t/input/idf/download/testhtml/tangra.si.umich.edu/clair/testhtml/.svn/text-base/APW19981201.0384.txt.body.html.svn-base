<HTML>    MADRID Spain AP  Chile's foreign minister said Tuesday that a Spanish judge's attempt to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet has polarized his homeland but poses no threat to Chilean democracy.    Jose Miguel Insulza began a round of talks Tuesday with Spanish officials attempting to persuade them to drop the extradition request so Pinochet can go home.    Acting on a Spanish judge's request police arrested Pinochet on Oct. 16 at a London clinic where he was recuperating from an operation. He faces charges of murder torture and genocide in Spain.    Insulza came here Monday after a four-day visit to Britain where he tried to persuade the Labor Party government not to extradite the 83-year-old former dictator.    Insulza met early Tuesday with Luis Lopez Supreme Court vice president and Juan Ignacio Barrero president of the Senate. He was scheduled to meet later in the day with Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and Foreign Minister Abel Matutes.    ``Democratic stability in Chile is not at risk'' Insulza said after his meeting with Barrero but urged a quick solution because ``it's affecting my country very much.''    Shortly after arriving Monday in Madrid Insulza said that the political climate in Spain would make a fair trial for Pinochet impossible.    Insulza said Pinochet could be tried in Chile if he is allowed to go home. Pinochet has immunity from prosecution in Chile and critics say even if this were lifted he would appear before a military court packed with his supporters.    British Home Secretary Jack Straw has 10 more days to decide whether to let Spain go ahead with extradition proceedings.    A Chilean government report says 3197 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the police after Pinochet seized power in a military coup that toppled democratically elected President Salvador Allende.
