<HTML>    PORT MORESBY Papua New Guinea AP  The power blackout in Papua New Guinea continued for the second day forced by a nationwide strike by trade unions protesting the government's budget.    The strike was called last Friday to demand Prime Minister Bill Skate to redraft next year's budget which slashes spending across most government departments axes 7000 public service jobs and abolishes key research institutions.    About 1300 workers for the main power supplier Elcom have cut power to all homes and businesses throughout the country from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.    Elcom National Staff Association general secretary Philip Kaira said it may begin targeting the blackout at only customers who owe large sums of money to Elcom in unpaid bills.    Kaira said the unions may disconnect power supplies to government buildings and offices including the Parliament House in Port Moresby.    Skate who has refused to redraft the budget says the strike is politically motivated and illegal.
