<HTML>    JAKARTA Indonesia AP  The death toll from a powerful earthquake that hit a remote island in Indonesia rose to 25 on Tuesday officials said.    The magnitude-6.5 quake hit Mangole island on Sunday night destroying buildings and houses and triggering landslides.    Initially six people were reported killed on the island about 1900 kilometers 1180 miles northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.    However the toll rose after reports were received from isolated villages said Budi Waluyo an official from Indonesia's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency in Jakarta.    Afraid that aftershocks might bring down their damaged homes about 7000 people slept in tents or in the open.    Widespread damage was also reported on neighboring Taliabu island but there were no reports of deaths there.    Local government officials said more than 150 people were injured and more than 180 homes and buildings were damaged on both islands.    Some houses slid into the sea. Roads were cut and bridges destroyed hampering search and rescue efforts.    Neither island has a major hospital. A local government official Karim Wamona said emergency flights were taking seriously injured victims to neighboring islands for urgent treatment.    Food and medicine were urgently needed officials said.    Five of the dead were killed when the roof of a timber factory collapsed.    Others were killed when their houses fell down. Some were killed by landslides.    One landslide destroyed Mangole's main shipping dock.    On Tuesday electricity supplies remained cut in many places and telecommunications with both islands were patchy.    The quake struck at 10:10 p.m. local time Sunday and was centered beneath the Maluku Sea about 370 kilometers 230 miles south of the city of Manado on the island of Sulawesi the Meteorological and Geophysics Agency said.    Mangole and Taliabu are part of the Maluku archipelago known in colonial times as the Spice Islands.    Earthquakes are common in Indonesia which lies astride the so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire''  a line of volcanically active areas that stretches from Central America and the western coast of North America across to Japan Southeast Asia the South Pacific and New Zealand.
