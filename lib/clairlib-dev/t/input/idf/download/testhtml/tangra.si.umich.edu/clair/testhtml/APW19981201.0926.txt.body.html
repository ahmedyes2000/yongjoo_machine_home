<HTML>    BORDEAUX France AP  Pointing his finger at the French judge American fugitive Ira Einhorn on Tuesday again denied he killed his girlfriend while the victim's family members glared at him in disbelief.    The graying former hippie guru fighting U.S. efforts to get him extradited back to Pennsylvania tried to persuade the judge of his innocence even though a U.S. court has found him guilty.    ``One thing'' Einhorn said pointing emphatically as he took the stand for his sole declaration. ``I did not kill Holly Maddux. C'est tout. That's all.''    The victim's family occasionally glared Einhorn before the judge deferred a decision on the extradition request - the second by the United States - until Jan. 12.    A prominent anti-war campaigner and activist in the 1960s Einhorn now 57 fled the United States shortly before his trial. But after 16 years in hiding he was tracked down and arrested at his French home in June 1997.    Elisabeth Hall the victim's sister traveled from Texas for the hearing with her two sisters and brother. She said the experience left her cold.    ``He was smirking as he said it'' Hall said. ``It was a clear attempt to provoke some kind of outburst. He's a pitiful character and he knows exactly what he's done.''    It was the first time in 20 years that the family saw Einhorn.    ``It was somewhat anti-climactic because I did not feel a surge of anger'' Hall said. ``But he was intimidated by our presence.''    When Maddux a former cheerleader from Tyler Texas disappeared Einhorn said she had gone shopping and never returned.    But 18 months later neighbors told police of a stench coming from Einhorn's apartment and Maddux's battered remains were found. Forensic experts said her skull had been smashed six times.    Maddux's family said they would consider returning to France in January and would continue to appeal if France rejects the extradition.    ``We are here in France to remind the judges that underneath all this international law and political squabbling there is a person who was murdered and who looks like us'' Hall said.    ``Anybody can see there has been a definite undercurrent of anti-Americanism'' she said.    A French court refused to extradite Einhorn in December 1997 citing a French law that would have required a retrial if he was extradited. Pennsylvania then passed a law promising Einhorn a retrial. He was re-arrested in September.    His defense lawyers argue that if extradited Einhorn could face the death penalty which is banned under French law. They also claim Pennsylvania courts might withdraw the pledge of a retrial.    ``This is not a matter of judging U.S. law'' said prosecution lawyer Francois Munch. ``This is a matter of finding who killed Holly Maddux.''    In a November interview on ABC television Einhorn declared his innocence and claimed the CIA or KGB framed him after he uncovered classified mind-control experiments.    ip-cb
