<HTML>    BRUSSELS Belgium AP  European Union finance ministers failed Tuesday to narrow differences over how to pay for plans to bring up to 12 new members into the Union over the coming decade.    British French and German ministers said there was growing support for plans to freeze EU spending up to 2006 around current levels of 85 billion European currency units dlrs 100 billion a year.    But less well off EU members  Spain Portugal Greece and Ireland  are seeking an increase in spending to ensure they don't lose out when even poorer nations in central and eastern Europe join the club.    ``It is a difficult area sufficient progress has not been made'' said Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger who chaired the day-long meeting.    The finance ministers had hoped to draw up guidelines on the budget debate to the leaders of the 15 EU nations who hold their year-end summit next week in Vienna.    Although the leaders are hoping to move the issue forward in the Austrian capital they have set a deadline of next Spring to overhaul the budget.    Complicating the question are demands by Germany the Netherlands Austria and Sweden for a reduction in their membership dues to the EU.
