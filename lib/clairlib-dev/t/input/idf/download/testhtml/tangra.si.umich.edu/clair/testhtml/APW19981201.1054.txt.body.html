<HTML>    CAIRO Egypt AP  Using magnetic sensors and computers Egyptian experts have located and mapped an important pharaonic city in the Nile Delta officials said Tuesday.    Ahmed Gouda Husain of the Geophysical Research Center said the experts have been able to create detailed images of Qantir which was a capital of one of Egypt's most famous kings Ramses II.    Ramses II a pharaoh in the so-called New Kingdom era ruled Egypt from 1304 to 1237 B.C.    ``It's a complete town with all its palaces houses streets and stables'' Husain told The Associated Press.    Husain said the team he heads has been using magnetic sensors to survey the city which also served as the capital of the Hyksos invaders for nearly a hundred years.    He said that surveying the city  covering a square kilometer about half a square mile of cotton corn and wheat fields  took about 45 days.    The team used a piece of equipment known as a ``graduometre'' which was provided by a German foundation to measure electric impulses and magnetic levels at the site Husain said.    Husain a geophysicist who has been working in archaeology for 15 years said the team later put the readings into a computer to generate images of the city.    Qantir some 114 kilometers 76 miles north of Cairo is covered with sandy mounds that archaeologists believe cover a number of pharaonic sites.    Gaballah Ali Gaballah head of Egypt's Supreme Council for Antiquities said the site was discovered in the 1920s. He said it would require at least 20 years of excavations to unearth the main sections of the city.    Husain said his team has used high-tech equipment to make a number of important archaeological discoveries in Egypt.    In Sohag in the south for example they found tombs and 12 buried solar boats designed to carry the dead in their after lives.  UR; sn-eap
