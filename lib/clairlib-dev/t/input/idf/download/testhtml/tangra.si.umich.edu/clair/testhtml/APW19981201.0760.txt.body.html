<HTML>    BUCHAREST Romania AP  A former head of Romanian foreign intelligence was quoted Tuesday as saying he will resign his present post as ambassador to Bulgaria after acknowledging that he hurt Swiss-Romanian relations in his previous job.    Ioan Talpes head of foreign intelligence from 1992 to 1997 resigned that position last year after admitting to a long-running contact between a Swiss diplomat and his foreign intelligence agents that he said had compromised ties with Switzerland.    Talpes 54 was quoted by the Mediafax news agency as saying he would stay on as ambassador until Dec. 20 a year after he was appointed by President Emil Constantinescu.    am/gj
