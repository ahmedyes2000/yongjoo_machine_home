<HTML>    AMMAN Jordan AP  The brother of Iraqi opposition leader Eyad Allawi was found dead here of a gunshot wound to the head and Jordanian security officials said Tuesday he apparently committed suicide because of financial problems.    Emad Allawi 55 was found dead in the back yard of his Amman apartment on Saturday the officials said. They said an investigation was under way but ruled out that the death was a murder.    The London-based Al-Hayat newspaper on Tuesday quoted unnamed ``independent sources'' in Jordan as saying Allawi died in a way suggesting he was killed by assailants working on behalf of the Iraqi government.    The paper also quoted unnamed Western diplomats in Amman as saying the Iraqi government is known to have plans to kill top Iraqi opposition leaders including Eyad Allawi.    Iraqi opposition members in Jordan said Allawi had serious financial problems but they did not give details.    They also said Allawi's body would be moved to neighboring Syria this week for burial next to his wife who died of cancer earlier this year.    The security officials and Iraqi exiles spoke on condition of anonymity.    Emad Allawi moved to Jordan in 1995 to establish a trading company. He did not join opposition groups while in exile.    But there were reports that Iraqi authorities confiscated his property and financial assets in Iraq to punish him for the defection of his brother.    Eyad Allawi heads the Iraqi National Accord a group of former military leaders and diplomats who defected from Iraq and advocate the overthrow of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.  UR; snm-jjh/eap
