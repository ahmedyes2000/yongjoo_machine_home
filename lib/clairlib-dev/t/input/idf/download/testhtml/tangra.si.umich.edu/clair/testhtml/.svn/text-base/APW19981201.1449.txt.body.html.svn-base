<HTML>    ARLINGTON Texas AP  Rafael Palmeiro is coming back to Texas.    The free agent first baseman and the Rangers agreed to a dlrs 45 million five-year contract on Tuesday five years after Texas signed Will Clark and let Palmeiro go to Baltimore.    Palmeiro who played for Texas from 1989-93 was a fan favorite during his first stint in Arlington.    But he was finished in Texas the day Clark signed a five-year dlrs 30 million deal with the Rangers. Palmeiro ended up getting an almost identical deal in Baltimore.    His departure was a bitter one with Palmeiro criticizing the Rangers' desire to win a World Series and telling a newspaper that Clark a teammate at Mississippi State had undercut him.    ``That's Will'' Palmeiro told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram at the time. ``That's the way he is. He's got no class. Friendship didn't matter to him. ... He's a low-life.''    Palmeiro also blasted Rangers management including President Tom Scheiffer who remains with the team.    Palmeiro who had just finished his best season in Texas with a .295 average 37 homers and 105 RBIs flourished with the Orioles and he always seemed to punish Texas pitchers. He hit .296 this year with 43 homers and 121 RBIs leading Baltimore in homers hits 183 and RBIs.    His return to Texas gives the Rangers something they have sorely lacked  power from the left side of the plate. Palmeiro will be able to take advantage of the short right-field porch at The Ballpark something Clark rarely seemed able to do here.    This time it's Clark's turn to look for another team.    ``We had initial interest from a number of teams but we had focused our attention on Texas which was Will's first choice'' said Clark's agent Jeff Moorad. ``At this point we'll go back to the other teams that have expressed interest and continue this game of musical chairs.''    While Moorad wouldn't say what teams he has talked to the Boston Red Sox and Orioles are said to be interested in Clark.    Palmeiro according to a pair of baseball sources turned down a dlrs 50 million five-year offer from Baltimore agreeing to a contract that calls for yearly salaries of dlrs 9 million including dlrs 1 million per season deferred.    Baltimore had been eager to bring Palmeiro back. The Orioles who signed Albert Belle to a dlrs 65 million five-year contract Tuesday also have lost Roberto Alomar Eric Davis and Alan Mills to free agency.
