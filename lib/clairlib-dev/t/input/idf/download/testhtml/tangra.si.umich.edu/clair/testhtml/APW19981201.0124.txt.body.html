<HTML>    KUWAIT AP  Former U.S. President George Bush arrived in Kuwait on Monday for a brief visit his third to a country that idolizes him as the hero of the 1991 Gulf War that ended a seven-month Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.    Although Bush's visit is a private one he was greeted at the airport by the crown prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah.    The former president planned to meet with U.S. Army troops stationed at Camp Doha north of Kuwait City. They maintain equipment prepositioned here to be used to defend Kuwait against any further Iraqi aggression.    Bush who is accompanied by a group of investors is to meet the emir Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah and attend a dinner with Kuwaiti dignitaries and businessmen. He leaves early Wednesday.    Security is tight and the press has been told it will have no access to Bush during the visit.    When Bush first came to Kuwait in April 1993 authorities uncovered a plot to assassinate him. Two Iraqis were sentenced to death in connection with the plot and several others were given prison terms.    Bush earlier visited Egypt and Saudi Arabia.  UR; de-eap
