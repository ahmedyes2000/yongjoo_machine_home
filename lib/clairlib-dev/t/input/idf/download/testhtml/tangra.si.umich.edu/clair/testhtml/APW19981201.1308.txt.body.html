<HTML>    ORLANDO Florida AP  Even when she had to go 20 extra holes to win the U.S. Women's Open Se Ri Pak had a way of making golf look easy  smooth swing remarkable patience and unwavering concentration.    If only the rest of her life were that simple.    The past six weeks have offered a glimpse of how the brightest star in women's golf since Nancy Lopez ultimately may not have enough space  not to mention freedom  for her potential to blossom.    During the LPGA Tour Championship in Las Vegas the 20-year-old rookie hit balls for Butch Harmon and played nine holes with his most important client Tiger Woods. Shortly thereafter reports surfaced that Pak would leave swing coach David Leadbetter at the end of the year to join Harmon's stable.    But late last week Pak was back on the range in Orlando Florida with Leadbetter at her side and her father nodding his approval.    ``They want to continue our relationship'' Leadbetter said. ``Everything was blown out of proportion. According to her they want me to help her to get to No. 1.''    This was confirmed by Pak in a release issued by Samsung the Korean electronics giant that sponsors Pak and ultimately calls all the shots.    ``My intentions were misinterpreted'' Pak said. She added that she enjoyed playing with Woods and meeting Harmon but then expressed ``great appreciation'' for Leadbetter.    Leadbetter who earlier this year received a letter from Nick Faldo terminating their relationship sounded as much relieved as he was perplexed. He has traveled the world having worked for Faldo and Nick Price Ernie Els and Greg Norman. Still he has never come across a situation like this one.    ``It's quite hard to make out'' he said. ``She has a lot of complex things in her life and the Korean mentality is a little different than what seems to be normal in the West. She's got so many people involved  a manager Samsung has another set of managers family friends an uncle a father who doesn't speak English. It's a tough deal.''    Imagine what it has been like for Pak.    Expectations in South Korea may be higher than anything Woods ever faced in America after he won the Masters. At least two dozen Korean photographers followed her every move this year especially after she won the LPGA Championship and the U.S. Open.    That was one reason Pak was reluctant to go home for a week of blockbuster celebrations the last week of October.    The news conference upon her arrival at the airport had to be stopped after 10 minutes because of the crowd. Her face was plastered on the front pages of almost every major newspaper. She was the lead item on the television news.    ``While I am here I want to take a rest no matter what'' Pak said. ``Going shopping and gossiping with friends that's what I want the most.''    Fat chance. Her week was loaded down with appearances and golf tournaments a parade and a medal ceremony with the president. Small wonder that Pak spent most of the week in a hospital recovering from a cold and exhaustion.    She wound up pulling out of the Japan Classic which in effect ended any chance Pak had of catching Annika Sorenstam in the points race for player of the year.    But then the way her whirlwind season had been going she didn't have much of a kick left in her. During one stretch this season Pak played 11 out of 13 weeks. After winning the Open she played the next four tournaments.    ``That really did her in'' Leadbetter said. ``She was playing on momentum and adrenaline and everybody wanted her to play. It was way too much. She wasn't working out she lost her fitness level. All these were contributing factors.''    Pak hasn't won since beating Dottie Pepper down the stretch to capture the Giant Eagle Classic on July 26. In her final nine tournaments of the year she finished inside the top 10 only once and her scoring average was 71.9 nearly one stroke higher than her first 18 tournaments.    ``It doesn't matter how good a horse is you can't race it every week'' Leadbetter said.    And that's why his next piece of advice may have more to do with ``shopping and gossiping'' than alignment and hip rotation. While playing golf with Woods Pak says she was inspired how to enjoy golf and how to enjoy life.    ``We can't forget that she's just a kid'' Leadbetter said.    That's an important reminder for Pak  and everyone around her.
