<HTML>    CAMBRIDGE England AP  One of Hollywood legend James Stewart's Air Force uniforms will go on display at a British air museum.    The uniform donated by the late actor's family will be presented among historic American combat aircraft at the Duxford Imperial War Museum at Cambridge the museum said Tuesday.    Stewart was already an Oscar-winning star when he flew 20 combat missions in World War II based at Tibenham England northeast of London. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the French Croix de Guerre.    He resumed his screen career after the war and made a total of 80 films the best known of which is the holiday classic ``It's a Wonderful Life.''    ``Jimmy Stewart was a great friend of Duxford'' museum director Ted Inman said. ``He helped greatly fund raising for the American Air Museum and we were sad he was never able to see the fruit of his works. This uniform on show to Duxford's 450000 visitors each year will remind us all that James Stewart was not only a fine actor but also a brave aviator who flew on perilous daylight missions from Britain.''    The museum didn't say when the uniform would go on display.    ms
