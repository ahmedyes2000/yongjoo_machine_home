<HTML>    TOKYO AP  Spanish striker Raul Gonzalez scored with eight minutes remaining and gave Real Madrid a 2-1 victory over Brazil's Vasco da Gama on Tuesday for its first Toyota Cup title since 1960.    Gonzalez settled Clarence Seedorf's cross before scoring giving Real the crown for the first time since it won the inaugural trophy 38 years ago.    An own goal by Nasa off a cross from Roberto Carlos gave Real the lead in the 25th minute but Vasco drew even in the 56th on a goal by Juninho.    The game was played before 51000 spectators at Japan's National Stadium in downtown Tokyo.
