<HTML>    MADRID Spain AP  Chile's foreign minister said Tuesday that his government is considering legal action against Gen. Augusto Pinochet but ruled out a deal guaranteeing he'd stand trial at home if Britain rejects an extradition request from Spain.    ``The government is studying whether to join existing suits'' the minister Jose Miguel Insulza told reporters referring to private lawsuits filed this year in Chile against the former despot.    ``The possibility of a trial in Chile exists and gets larger every day'' Insulza said to back his argument that trying Pinochet in Spain for crimes committed during his 1973-1990 dictatorship is unnecessary.    Human rights activists have dismissed this possibility because Pinochet has wide-ranging immunity at home.    Insulza insisted that Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon's attempt to extradite Pinochet to Spain on charges of genocide terrorism and torture was an affront to Chilean sovereignty and its transition to democracy.    A Chilean government report says 3197 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the police after Pinochet seized power in a military coup that toppled democratically elected Marxist President Salvador Allende.    Chile Insulza said was ``under no obligation'' to promise that the 83-year-old retired general would stand trial if allowed home from London where he has been under police guard pending possible extradition since being detained on Oct. 16 while recuperating from back surgery.    Insulza said Chile should be allowed to deal with the legacy of general's 17 years in power without interference.    ``There is no reason to call into doubt the solidity of democracy in Chile or our capacity to resolve our own problems'' Insulza said after stressing that the affair had triggered ``polarization break down of dialogue and sharp political confrontation.''    Insulza was speaking after talks with his Spanish counterpart Abel Matutes. Later he met with Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.    During a 40-minute meeting with Insulza Aznar reiterated that Pinochet's fate depended on Britain not Spain Europe Press reported quoting government officials.    Prior to arriving in Madrid Monday Insulza spent four days lobbying the British government whose Home Secretary Jack Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to allow extradition proceedings to go ahead.    Insulza who said his trip had produced ``some positive indications'' but he declined to give details.    As well as Matutes and Aznar the Chilean minister filled up his Spanish agenda by holding meetings with Defense Minister Eduardo Serra congressional president Federico Trillo leaders from the main opposition Socialist party Supreme Court Deputy President Luis Lopez and Senate President Juan Ignacio Barrero.    He was to meet Spanish business leaders later Tuesday before leaving for Chile on a nightime flight.    jt/dw
