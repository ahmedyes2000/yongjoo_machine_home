<HTML>    MOSCOW AP  With Russia's leaders urgently seeking financial help International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus began two days of talks in Moscow on Tuesday on Russia's frozen loan agreement with the IMF.    Camdessus met Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov later Tuesday and is scheduled to hold broader talks with government officials Wednesday.    ``I want to get better acquainted with the prime minister'' Camdessus told reporters upon arrival in Moscow on Tuesday night. ``I presume we will be having interesting conversations.''    President Boris Yeltsin who is in the hospital receiving treatment for pneumonia on Tuesday spoke with Primakov by telephone to discuss the government's stance at the talks with Camdessus.    Russia is seeking further installments on an IMF bailout package that was reached in the summer but was frozen after the government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August. The IMF has said the government must come up with a realistic recovery plan before more money will be released.    Camdessus is not expected to announce any breakthroughs but his visit does give Russia an opportunity to make its case and lobby for fresh funds.    The bailout package totals dlrs 22.6 billion and also involves the World Bank and the Japanese government but Russia has so far received only about dlrs 5 billion.    An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer subsidies to ailing industries.    ``The IMF has plenty of reasons to say to Russia `you guys want to borrow money from us while cutting taxes without having learned how to collect them''' the liberal daily Vremya said Tuesday.    If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon it will probably have to start printing money which would drive up inflation.    ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid hyperinflation'' Oleg Sysuyev a top presidential aide was quoted as saying Tuesday by the Interfax news agency.    The government has been delaying a debate on next year's budget as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet its expenses. The Cabinet again delayed the discussion this week but insisted the delay was not connected with Camdessus' visit.    However the Russian media claimed the government put off action on the budget because it is still hoping for the IMF loans.    ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague and their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit'' the business daily Kommersant said Tuesday.    Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko who was on a trip to the United States this week said Russia wouldn't be able to pay dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt that comes due next year.    ``The IMF must realize that and accept compromises with Russia in reaching agreements on restructuring foreign debts'' Kiriyenko said at New York University on Monday according to the Interfax news agency.    vi/gm/adc
