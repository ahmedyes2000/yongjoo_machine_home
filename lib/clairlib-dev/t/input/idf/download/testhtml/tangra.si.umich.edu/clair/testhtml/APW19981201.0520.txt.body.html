<HTML>    LONDON AP  Gen. Augusto Pinochet is distressed at demands by a London hospital that he leave and he will likely move to a new location later Tuesday the former Chilean dictator's British attorney said.    Pincohet had planned to move on Monday from the Grovelands Priory a private psychiatric hospital in north London where he has been under police guard since Oct. 29 but the arrangement fell through because of ``unforeseen practical difficulties'' said lawyer Michael Caplan.    The hospital announced Monday afternoon that there is nothing wrong with Pinochet and he should go  dealing a blow to any plan by the 83-year-old general to plead he is too ill to be extradited to Spain to stand trial on charges of genocide and torture.    Adding to his troubles an opinion poll published Tuesday indicated that a narrow majority  51 percent  of Britons think Pinochet should be extradited.    ``Senator Pinochet and his family are distressed by reports yesterday concerning the senator's stay in at Groveland Priory Hospital'' said Caplan.    He said he received court approval on Friday to vary bail conditions and ``it is anticipated the move will take place later today.''    Pinochet's supporters have said they are looking for a secure and comfortable home where he can stay while he fights extradition.    A Chilean government report says some 3000 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's 1970-93 rule.    But Chile is trying to get him back because of fears that the anger of his supporters may destabilize its democracy.    Chile's foreign minister Jose Miguel Insulza was in Spain Tuesday after lobbying British officials arguing that Pinochet may be tried in Chile if he is freed.    Home Secretary Jack Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether the extradition proceedings can go ahead.    British newspapers have speculated that Pinochet is seeking to move to a nine-bedroom home on a luxurious estate in Surrey near the Wentworth Golf Club home of the European golf tour about 20 miles 30 kms west of central London.    Wherever he goes Pinochet is likely to cause disruption. Chilean exiles mount demonstration and there is a police guard and heavy police presence.    In addition The Guardian newspaper quoting unidentified Grovelands Priory officials said the general is a fussy and complaining patient.    A National Opinion poll published in London's Evening Standard said 51 percent of a 961-strong sample of voters questioned nationwide said Pinochet should be extradited 32 percent wanted him sent home and the rest had no opinion. The error margin was plus or minus three percent.    A statement by U.S. State Department James P. Rubin Monday that the international community should show ``significant respect'' for Chile's point of view was widely interpreted in British newspapers as a nod toward Straw to let Pinochet go.    On Monday Pinochet's nephew Rafael Saavedra Pinochet denied a report in a British tabloid The Mirror that he had said his uncle would rather die than face trial in Spain.    mb-mj
