<HTML>    LONDON AP  German President Roman Herzog kicked off a four-day state visit at Windsor Castle Tuesday by viewing a giant handmade gilded orb and cross created by British craftsmen for the people of Dresden as a symbol of friendship and reconciliation over World War II.    The 18-foot 5.5- meter orb and cross is a replica of the ornament that once graced the skyline of Dresden atop the Baroque Frauenkirche. The original was destroyed when the church was reduced to rubble in a two-day Anglo-American bomb raid on the city during World War II.    The 1.5 ton copper and stainless steel creation was made by hand in the old-fashioned way as requested by the people of Dresden. It was commissioned by the Dresden Trust a group of people in Britain who raised around 300000 pounds dlrs 495000 from individuals charities and companies across the country.    Herzog and his wife Christiane are the first to be entertained by Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle since fire ripped through it in 1992 destroying some of its historic sections.    The Herzogs were met at London's Heathrow Airport by the queen's cousin the Duke of Kent and escorted to join the queen and her husband Prince Phillip for a carriage procession through the streets of Windsor and into the castle as crowds lined the streets to look on.    But before the procession reached the gates of the castle a cavalryman escorting the carriages was thrown from his horse when it reared. The rider who was wearing a heavy breastplate and armor fell on a sanded road infront of the queen's carriage. He was taken to a local hospital with shoulder and spine injuries.    ``The incident did not delay the procession but did cause a short delay to the military band entering the castle'' said a spokeswoman for Thames Valley Police speaking on customary condition of anonymity.    The Herzogs were scheduled to visit a German school and have tea with the Queen Mother Elizabeth before attending a state banquet at the castle where they are staying.    Other stops scheduled for later in the tour include Edinburgh Castle and the queen's Holyroodhouse palace in Scotland as well as museums art galleries churches and hospitals.    Herzog will meet with Prime Minister Tony Blair and other political leaders and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey.    The Herzogs were also expected to attend the premiere of a German film in London on their final night and Mrs. Herzog was to visit Burberry's the clothing store.    The last state visit by a German president was in July 1986 by President Richard von Weizsacker. The queen last paid a state visit to Germany in 1992.    er
