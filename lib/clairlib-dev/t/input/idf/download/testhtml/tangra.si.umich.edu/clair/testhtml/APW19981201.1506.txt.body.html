<HTML>    LONDON AP  More than 500 police officers swarmed a suspected drugs lair used by traffickers to supply millions of pounds dollars of cocaine  in one of the largest raids ever in central London.    Scotland Yard said Wednesday that 39 people were arrested for drugs and drugs-related offenses after the Tuesday night raid on a four-story building on Charing Cross Road the heart of the capital's theater district. Police said the building which had been operating as an unlicensed club was a clearing house for illegal drugs.    ''This has been running for months'' Police Chief Superintendent Jim Overton said. ''Rather than just go for the people in there we are going for the organizers ... We are very pleased with the results so far. It looks very very promising.''    The substances found were still being analyzed and the search of the building was expected to continue throughout Wednesday.    Describing the building as a ''fortified drugs warehouse'' Overton said hundreds of officers were needed because the building was reinforced with steel doors and floors. Two other addresses in London had also been searched in connection with the investigation.    Police released no other information.    mb
