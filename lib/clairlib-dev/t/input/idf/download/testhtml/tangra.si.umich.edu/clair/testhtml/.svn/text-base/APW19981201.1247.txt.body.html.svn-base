<HTML>    ATLANTIC CITY New Jersey AP  What's Saturday night at the fights without a cigar?    The operators of the Atlantic City Convention Center a no-smoking building will not enforce the ban when the building holds its first boxing match this weekend.    The exemption will apply only to sports events at the dlrs 268 million center which opened in mid-1997. Conventioneers and others who rent the building or attend events there won't be allowed to light up according to Gregg Caren assistant general manager.    ``When it comes to sporting events smoking is permitted'' he said. ``If it was a meeting or a conference we'd operate it as a no-smoking building. But at a boxing match anyone knows going in that they're expecting smoke.''    The center is operated by the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Authority just as Convention Hall is. Convention Hall the site of most major fights in Atlantic City is a no-smoking building as well but the ban is not enforced at sports events.    Promoter Don King who is promoting the WBA world bantamweight championship fight between Nana Konadu and Johnny Tapia said the issue never came up during negotiations for the fight which is expected to attract up to 6000 people.    It's healthier to skip the cigars anyway King said Tuesday.    ``Do like I do'' he said. ``Use 'em for a prop. Put 'em in your mouth and don't light 'em like I do.''
