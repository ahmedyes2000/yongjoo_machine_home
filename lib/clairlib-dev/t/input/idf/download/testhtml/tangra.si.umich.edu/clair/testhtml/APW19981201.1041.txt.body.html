<HTML>    MADRID Spain AP  Chile's foreign minister said Tuesday that his government is considering legal action against Gen. Augusto Pinochet but ruled out a deal guaranteeing he'd stand trial at home if Britain rejects an extradition request from Spain.    The minister Jose Miguel Insulza has argued that it is unnecessary to try Pinochet in Spain for crimes committed during his 1973-1990 dictatorship. A government lawsuit would strengthen his case.    ``The government is studying whether to join existing suits'' filed this year in Chile Insulza said. ``The possibility of a trial in Chile exists and gets larger every day.''    Human rights activists have dismissed the possibility of a Chilean trial for the former dictator since has wide-ranging immunity at home.    A Chilean government report says 3197 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the police after Pinochet seized power in a military coup that toppled the democratically elected president Salvador Allende.    Chile Insulza said was ``under no obligation'' to promise that the 83-year-old retired general would stand trial if allowed home from London where he has been under police guard since being detained Oct. 16 while recuperating from back surgery.    Insulza insisted that a Spanish judge's attempt to extradite Pinochet on charges of genocide terrorism and torture was an affront to Chilean sovereignty and its transition to democracy.    According to Insulza who is pressing for Pinochet's release Chile should be allowed to deal with the legacy of general's 17 years in power without interference.    Pinochet has many supporters there is widespread fear of violence if he is prosecuted.    ``There is no reason to call into doubt the solidity of democracy in Chile or our capacity to resolve our own problems'' Insulza said after stressing that the affair had triggered ``polarization break down of dialogue and sharp political confrontation.''    Spain's foreign minister Abel Matutes said the Spanish government was powerless to act since all remaining decisions on Pinochet's fate were in British hands. Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar reiterated that message in a 40-minute meeting Europe Press reported quoting government officials.    Earlier Tuesday Insulza met Supreme Court Deputy President Luis Lopez and Senate President Juan Ignacio Barrero.    Prior to arriving Monday in Madrid Insulza spent four days lobbying the British government whose Home Secretary Jack Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to let extradition proceedings go ahead.    Insulza said his trip had produced ``some positive indications'' but he declined to give details.    He was to meet Spanish business leaders before leaving for Chile on a Tuesday night flight.
