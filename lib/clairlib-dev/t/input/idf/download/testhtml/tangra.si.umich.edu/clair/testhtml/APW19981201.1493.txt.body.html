<HTML>    TOKYO AP  Japan Tobacco Inc. has decided to take part in the dlrs 206 billion settlement between U.S. states and the tobacco industry for health care reimbursements.    Japan Tobacco will chip in about dlrs 1.4 million a year starting in 2000 as its share in the settlement reached last month between 46 states and four major U.S. tobacco companies but its share may increase over the years spokesman Yoshiro Go said Wednesday.    Japan Tobacco will also comply with other provisions of the settlement including restrictions on advertising and the targeting of minors but such terms will not affect its business in Japan he said.    Although it has not been sued in the United States Japan Tobacco decided to join the settlement Monday because that was seen as a better business decision in the long term Go said.    Japan Tobacco sells about 800 million cigarettes a year in the United States for a market share of about 0.15 percent.    At home where it sells 256 billion cigarettes a year or about 77 percent of the market it is facing four lawsuits over alleged tobacco-related illnesses.  UR; yk
