<HTML>    ROME AP  AS Roma the Italian first division soccer club is close to taking over France's second division team Nice in an effort to expand the growth of young talents.    A spokesman for the Roman club which is owned by Italian industrialist Francesco Sensi said Tuesday that negotiations with Nice had entered the final stage.    ``But the formal final agreement has not yet been reached'' the spokesman said.    Club officials said the control of the French team was intended to grant Roma the possibility to fish for young players in France and in other countries.    ``Nice would be a sort of breeding-ground for young players and for those players Roma can't immediately field'' the spokesman explained.    Roma is currently second to Fiorentina in the Italian League standings while Nice is the last-place in the 20-team French second division.  UR; pv
