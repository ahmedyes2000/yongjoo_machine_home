<HTML>    LONDON AP  The parents of a British woman convicted of heroin trafficking in Thailand have appealed to the British government for help in persuading the King of Thailand to reduce her 22-year prison sentence.    Sandra Gregory 33 was convicted in 1996 and sentenced to 25 years in a Thai prison after being stopped at the Bangkok airport with more than 100 grams 3.5 ounces of heroin. Her sentence was later reduced to 22 years under a general amnesty from the King of Thailand and she was transferred to a British prison last year under a British-Thai prisoner exchange treaty.    In a letter published in Tuesday's edition of the Scotsman newspaper Stan and Doreen Gregory say they believe the government should write to the King of Thailand requesting a reduction in the sentence.    The couple say their daughter was ill when she tried to smuggle heroin from Bangkok to Tokyo in 1993.    While they accept her crime was serious they contrast her case with those of other Britons convicted of drugs offenses in Thailand and the case of British nurses Lucille McLauchlan and Deborah Parry who were released after being convicted in Saudi Arabia of killing Australian nurse Yvonne Gilford.    The couple also cite the case of two women who were released from a Bangkok jail in 1993 after the intervention of then Prime Minister John Major. They had been convicted of having 4 million pounds dlrs 6.6 million worth of heroin.    er
