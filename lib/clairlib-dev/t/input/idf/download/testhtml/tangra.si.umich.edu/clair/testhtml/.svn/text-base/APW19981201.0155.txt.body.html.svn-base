<HTML>    MONTREAL AP  With two struggling teams facing each other the winner needed a little luck.    Montreal center Saku Koivu was credited with the game's opening goal at the 6:17 mark of the second period. But it was Los Angeles defenseman Sean O'Donnell who actually steered Koivu's rebound into his own net.    That started the Canadiens to a 3-1 victory Monday night as Montreal snapped a three-game losing streak.    ``They needed a break  they're struggling  and they got it'' O'Donnell said. ``It just continues for us.''    It was the only NHL game played Monday.    Los Angeles 6-14-3 has only managed to accumulate five points two wins and a tie in its last 14 games and has lost eight of its last nine.    Despite sliding face down toward the net Koivu managed to direct a shot towards the Kings' goal that seemed to catch Los Angeles goalie Stephane Fiset by surprise. Fiset made a toe save but O'Donnell's stick directed the puck into the open side to Fiset's left.    ``I made the save and Sean O'Donnell tried just to put the puck in the corner but it hit his stick and went right in'' Fiset said. ``It's getting frustrating for us because we aren't getting any of the bounces.''
