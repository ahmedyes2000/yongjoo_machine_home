Seven other children were also still hospitalized after the accident in a movie theater in the town of Chervonohrad 450 kilometers 279 miles west of the capital Kiev.

Police have not determined who was to blame for the deaths Oleksiy Brukh of Chervonohrad's municipal council told the Interfax news agency. The Emergency Situations Ministry however blamed movie theater personnel for violating safety rules.    ``Armageddon'' has been one of the most popular films in Ukraine for several months and the theater was the only one showing the film in Chervonohrad.    About 800 children from five schools in Chervonohrad came to the two afternoon showings of the film  the one that was ending when the accident occurred and the one that was about to start.    President Leonid Kuchma sent a telegram of condolences and ordered local authorities to assist the families that lost their children.    str/vl/sms/adc
