<HTML>    LONDON AP  The Football Association said Tuesday it hoped to resolve financial misconduct charges early next year against Premier League club Nottingham Forest.    Charges against former manager Brian Clough were dropped three months ago but similar charges of unauthorized payments in transfer deals made in the late 1980 and early '90s are still hanging over other club officials.    Forest chief executive Phil Soar said Tuesday it was ``an absolute disgrace'' the charges brought 11 months ago were unresolved.    ``It is a complex case and we are at present awaiting legal advice on an important piece of evidence'' an FA spokesman said.     QC;     LEICESTER England AP  Leicester manager Martin O'Neill still hasn't signed a new contract and admits his days could be numbered.    In October Leicester offered O'Neill a lucrative new contract to stave off a bid from Leeds. At the time Leicester officials denied O'Neill permission to talk with Leeds.    O'Neill now says he is only being ``tolerated'' by the club board which he says has been interfering in on-the-pitch matters.    ``I want to run the football club the way I see fit'' O'Neill said Tuesday. ``I know more about football than the people on the board so I'll live and die by the results.''    Leicester is in 13th place 11 points behind leaders Aston Villa.     QC;     BLACKBURN England AP  Last-place Blackburn Rovers is rumored to be looking at a long list of choices to replace Roy Hodgson who was fired as manager last month.    The list is reported to include ex-Liverpool coach Roy Evans Graeme Souness of Portugal's Benfica and Manchester United assistant Brian Kidd.    Manchester United has blocked Blackburn's attempt to talk with Kidd.    Scottish international Colin Hendry was voted by Blackburn fans as their choice to follow Hodgson. But Hendry says he's staying with Glasgow Rangers quashing rumors he could return as player-manager.    ``My playing career carries on at Rangers'' he said Tuesday. ``I'm happy here and that's the end of the story. As far as I'm concerned by future and my career are at Rangers.''     QC;     NEWCASTLE England AP  David Batty trained Tuesday with Newcastle with a disagreement over his transfer fee holding up his move to back to Leeds.    Batty last week asked Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit for a transfer to Leeds  his hometown. Leeds is reported to have offered 4 million pounds dlrs 6.6 million with Newcastle asking for 6 million pounds dlrs 10 million.    ``Without revealing how much we think he is worth I would say 4 million is nowhere near enough'' said Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd.    Batty still lives with his family in Leeds and says he'd like to return to the club.    scw
