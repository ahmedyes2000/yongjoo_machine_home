<HTML>    LONDON AP  England full-back Matt Perry has been ruled out of Saturday's rugby union Test against South Africa at Twickenham.    Perry suffered a concussion during last weekend's defeat against Australia and will be sidelined for three weeks England coach Clive Woodward said Tuesday.    With Paul Grayson and Will Greenwood still questionable with injuries Woodward called up David Rees and Alex King into the squad to provide cover at wing and fly-half.    Perry was injured in the final seconds of the 12-11 defeat against the Wallabies at Twickenham. Doctors said he should take off at least three weeks.    Grayson who limped off with a knee injury against the Aussies and center Greenwood who failed to make the match are still under treatment.    Perry's absence could clear the way for in-form Northampton full-back Nick Beal to take over although Woodward won't be making any further announcements until Thursday.    Mike Catt who last played for England against France last February could also be considered at full-back.    Scrum-half Kyran Bracken will also miss the Springboks clash due to injury meaning a chance for Matt Dawson. Fly-half Jonny Wilkinson is out with fitness problems.    Rees who only recently returned to action after suffering a serious groin injury last season will strongly challenge wing incumbents Tony Underwood and Austin Healey.    Rees hasn't played for England since the Five Nations Championship earlier this year while King is set to pressure Catt as a possible replacement for number 10 and goalkicker Paul Grayson.    The South Africa Springboks will set a world record of 18 consecutive Test victories if they beat England on Saturday. They would eclipse the New Zealand All Blacks' 17-match winning streak between 1965 and 1969.    ``I don't see any country going through a winning run of 17 or 18 Tests in the future'' Springboks coach Nick Mallett said.    sw
