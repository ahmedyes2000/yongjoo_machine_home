Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said Thursday the central bank could pause from its 22-month chain of interest rate increases as the economy slows in coming months, even if there is still a risk of higher inflation. 

Bernanke told Congress that the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee might call a halt to assess the strength of the economy and inflation pressures.  The Fed, which expects the economy to expand less briskly later this year as the housing market sags, also has a keen eye on energy prices. 

"Even if in the committee's judgment, the risks to its objectives are not entirely balanced, at some point in the future the committee may decide to take no action at one or more meetings in the interest of allowing more time to receive information relevant to the outlook," Bernanke said.  "Of course, a decision to take no action at a particular meeting does not preclude actions at subsequent meetings. "

The stock market reacted positively, with traders judging rate moves as nearly done.  Bond prices rose, and interest rates fell.  The Fed has raised rates 15 times, from 1% to 4. 75%. 

Brian Wesbury of First Trust Portfolios suggested the statements were a sign of "flexibility and uncertainty" not finality. 

"Although the Fed may put rate hikes on hold at some point, underlying trends suggest that a pause short of neutral will be temporary," said Wesbury, expecting the Fed to eventually push its target for short-term rates to 5. 5% to 6%. 

After the Fed's most recent quarter-point interest rate rise on March 28, it said the economic risks were tilted toward higher inflation.  Bernanke said data since then had not "materially changed" that assessment, while noting that rising energy prices created a "difficult problem" because they could both breed inflation and slow the economy.  The Fed will watch to see if businesses pass the higher costs on to consumers. 

"If that were to happen and if expectations of inflation were thereby to rise, that would be very deleterious to...long-term growth," Bernanke said. 

Fifty-one top economists surveyed by USA TODAY this month expected the Fed to raise rates by a quarter-point at its May 10 meeting, but most expected the central bank to then stop. 

Bernanke said policy depends on how future data affect the Fed's medium-term outlook.  Since it takes months for interest rate moves to work through the economy, the Fed must be careful not to raise rates too much and slow growth too much.  But it also doesn't want to be soft on inflation. 

"It may take a while for the economy to catch up with (Fed) policy moves.  . . .  They're moving toward this more neutral area," says Michael Wallace of Action Economics.
