<HTML>    KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia AP  The trial of jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim was put on hold Wednesday as the judge turned his attention to a lawyer who has accused prosecutors of forcing a man to lie about Anwar's alleged sexual trysts.    Manjeet Singh Dhillon accused of contempt of court is a lawyer for Anwar's former tennis partner Nallakaruppan Solaimalai who is being tried for illegal possession of ammunition a charge that carries a mandatory death sentence.    Nallakaruppan or Nalla as he is commonly known was detained under the Internal Security Act before Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest.    On Monday a warrant was issued by the court for Manjeet Singh after he wrote a letter accusing prosecutors of trying to force Nalla to enter into a plea bargain by giving false evidence against Anwar.    Authorities say 125 bullets were found in Nalla's house during a police investigation of allegations published in the book ``Fifty Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim Cannot Become Prime Minister.''    In the book it is alleged that Nalla set up sexual trysts for Anwar while the 51-year-old politician was still deputy prime minister and heir apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.    Proceedings against Nalla are separate from Anwar's trial for four counts of abuse of office. Anwar will face trial later for one more charge of corruption and five counts of illegal sex acts.    Both Anwar and Nalla deny the charges against them.    Manjeet Singh's letter formed the basis for an affidavit for which Zainur Zakaria a prominent lawyer on Anwar's defense team has been sentenced to three months in jail for maligning the prosecutors. Zainur will go to jail if he loses an appeal Friday.    The proceedings against Zainur and Manjeet Singh both eminent Malaysian lawyers and former presidents of the bar council have stunned the legal community. But there has been no public comment from the council the association of attorneys.    Anwar's trial began Nov. 4 but was adjourned during a summit last month of Pacific Rim leaders held in Kuala Lumpur.
