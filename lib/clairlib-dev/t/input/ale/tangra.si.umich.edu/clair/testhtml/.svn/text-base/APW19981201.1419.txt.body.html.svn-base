<HTML>    NEW YORK AP  Locked-out National Basketball Association players felt another squeeze on their wallets Tuesday before a glimmer of hope suddenly emerged.    Collective bargaining talks on hold for nearly two weeks will resume Thursday in New York with ``everything back on the table'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said.    Commissioner David Stern and union director Billy Hunter spoke by telephone and agreed to a session involving the owners' and players' full negotiating committees  the first since Nov. 20.    ``Billy called David and it was agreed that there are no deal-killers or other preconditions. Neither side is now committed to anything and whatever was put on the table at the last meeting is now undone'' Granik said.    Talks originally were scheduled to resume last weekend but the sides found themselves arguing over what was agreed to in the Nov. 20 session and whether there would be preconditions for a resumption.    Owners are again asking for a 50-50 split and the players are asking for 60 percent of revenues. Each side had moved three percentage points in the Nov. 20 meeting.    ``We're back where we started'' Granik said. ``We agree we're better off meeting than not meeting.''    As the lockout moved into its sixth month players missed their second payday.    For stars like union president Patrick Ewing who was due to earn dlrs 18 million this season that meant another lost dlrs 900000 check.    ``The unprepared players are the ones who are getting hurt'' said Eric Snow of the Philadelphia 76ers who should have had about dlrs 35000 directly deposited into his bank account. ``If you paid attention to the threats you planned ahead and saved more money than you ever thought you'd have needed.''    Snow took his agent's advice and salted away as much of last season's dlrs 700000 salary as possible. His pay was supposed go up to dlrs 840000 this season but the length of the lockout means he'll lose at least one-third of it.    Snow figures he can make it another few months before deciding whether to liquidate some of his investments or take out a loan to meet his living expenses. Meantime he's knows he might never recoup the money he's losing.    ``It's a big bite but you hope the sacrifice is substantially worth it in the end'' Snow said. ``You take a hit now and hope it benefits you later.''    Snow's salary is actually small by NBA standards falling below the average salary of about dlrs 2.4 million and the median of about dlrs 1.2 million.    Since the season won't start until January at the earliest players also will miss checks Dec. 15 and Jan. 1.    Of the approximately dlrs 1 billion players were supposed to earn this season more than dlrs 300 million has been lost.
