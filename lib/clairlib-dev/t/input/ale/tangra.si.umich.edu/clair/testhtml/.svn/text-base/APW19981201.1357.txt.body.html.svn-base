<HTML>    LONDON AP  Holders Chelsea were knocked out of the League Cup Tuesday as Premier League rival Wimbledon won 2-1 in a quarterfinal match on goals by Robbie Earle and a penalty 15 minutes from time by Michael Hughes.    Chelsea's player-coach Gianluca Vialli scored with six minutes remaining to make the final minutes interesting.    It was a bad night for French defender Frank Leboeuf as Chelsea's 19-game unbeaten string ended.    Leboeuf gave away a free kick from which Earle headed the Dons in front after 19 minutes. And his misery was compounded at the end when he brought down Marcus Gayle to hand the home side a penalty which Hughes converted.    ``If we win the next round we will be at Wembley but there is no point looking so far forward'' said Hughes. ``We are a small club and have no money to buy 5 or 6-million pound players. But we have quality players here and we work very hard for each other.''    In Tuesday's other League Cup quarterfinal the first division's first-place team Sunderland defeated second-division Luton 3-0 to reach the semifinals of the League Cup for the first time in 14 years.    Sunderland took a 1-0 lead on Marvin Johnson's own-goal five minutes before the half. Michael Bridges made it 2-0 in the 89th and Niall Quinn made it 3-0 in second-half injury time.    In an F.A. Cup first-round replay Notts County won 3-0 over semi-pro side Hendon. In another first-round replay Kidderminster and Plymouth played a 0-0 draw after extra time with Kidderminster winning 5-4 on penalties.    scw
