<HTML>    NEW YORK AP  Another wild day in U.S. baseball's offseason marketplace left half a dozen big names on new teams.    After Rafael Palmeiro went back to Texas Otis Nixon returned to Atlanta and Albert Belle formalized his deal with Baltimore the New York Mets Los Angeles Dodgers and Orioles pulled off a surprising three-way trade The Associated Press learned.    When the wheel stopped spinning Tuesday night New York had acquired outfielder Roger Cedeno from the Dodgers and reliever Armando Benitez from the Orioles Baltimore got catcher Charles Johnson and Los Angeles wound up with catcher Todd Hundley and minor league pitcher Arnold Gooch.    The big money deals Palmeiro dlrs 45 million for five years and Belle dlrs 65 million for five years were overshadowed by the big three-way trade a rarity in baseball's free-agent era.    First the Mets sent Hundley and Gooch to the Dodgers for Johnson and Cedeno and then they sent Johnson to Baltimore for Benitez.    Hundley who is to be paid dlrs 5.2 million next season and dlrs 6 million in 2000 became expendable after New York re-signed Mike Piazza to a dlrs 91 million seven-year deal in October.    Hundley struggled last season after returning from the disabled list in July following reconstructive surgery on his right elbow at the end of the 1997 season.    He hit just .161 with three homers 12 RBIs and 55 strikeouts in 124 at-bats limiting his trade value. Before the injury Hundley was one of the most feared hitters in the league.    Hundley a 29-year-old switch-hitter set a big-league record for homers by a catcher in 1996 hitting 41 to surpass Roy Campanella's 43-year-old standard. Hundley also hit .259 and drove in 112 runs that year.    Benitez gives the Mets added depth in their bullpen. He went 5-6 with a 3.82 ERA and 22 saves last season for Baltimore. He will most likely be the right-handed setup man for closer John Franco.    Johnson 27 came to the Dodgers along with Gary Sheffield Bobby Bonilla Jim Eisenreich and a minor league pitcher for Piazza and third baseman Todd Zeile last May 15. Piazza was traded to the Mets a week later.    Johnson played in 133 games with the Marlins and Dodgers last season and hit just .218 with 19 homers and 58 RBIs.    The 24-year-old Cedeno a switch hitter long considered a top prospect played in 105 games for the Dodgers last season and hit .242 with two homers and 17 RBIs.
