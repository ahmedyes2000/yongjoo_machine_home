<HTML>    TOKYO AP  The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen at midday Wednesday following its slip on overseas markets. Japanese stocks turned mixed.    The dollar bought 121.84 yen in late morning trading down 1.07 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 122.17 yen overnight.    The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 63.37 points or 0.43 percent to end the morning session at 14898.78. On Tuesday the Nikkei closed down 48.29 points or 0.32 percent.    In currency dealings the dollar remained weak against the yen in the absence of fresh market-moving news after its slide on overseas markets in reaction to the release of disappointing U.S. economic data.    The National Association of Purchasing Management reported Tuesday the manufacturing sector in the United States slowed for the sixth consecutive month in November.    On the stock market share prices were mixed as investors took to the sidelines to monitor parliamentary debate on a government-sponsored supplementary budget to spur the nation's sagging economy.    Market players said trading was stuck in a narrow range amid a lack of fresh news on the government's economic policies.    Investors also were reluctant to make significant moves ahead of the sale of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. and next week's ``special quotation'' settlement of December futures and options traders said.    The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first section was down 0.29 points or 0.03 percent to 1141.97. The TOPIX closed down 1.24 points or 0.11 percent the day before.    The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond was quoted at 1.165 percent up from Tuesday's close of 1.140 percent driving its price down to 105.44 yen from the previous day's 105.68.
