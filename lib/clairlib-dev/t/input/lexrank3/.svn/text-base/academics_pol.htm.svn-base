					  <td><em>It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to be
						    familiar with all policies and procedures
					    of the College. It is ultimately the student&rsquo;s responsibility
						    to meet all graduation
					    requirements.</em><br>
					    <br>
						  Academic policies and procedures are established by
						  the faculty to ensure the
						  integrity of the academic program at Kalamazoo College.
						  The Committee on 
						  Academic Standards is charged by the faculty to take
						  action on petitions made
						  by students for adjustments to academic rules and policies.<br>
						  <br>
						  A petition must be made in writing and submitted to
						  the Registrar to be
						  forwarded to the Committee on Academic Standards.<BR>
						  <br>
						  <span class="subheading">						  Earning Course Credit</span><br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Credit</span><br>
						  The Kalamazoo College credit is referred to as a unit.
						  Each unit is equivalent to
						  5 quarter hours or 3.33 semester hours.<br>						  
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Credit Load</span><br>
						  Kalamazoo College is on the quarter system. Each quarter
						  is composed of ten
						  weeks of class plus an examination week, for a total
						  of 11 weeks. Students
						  normally carry a full-time course load of three units
						  per quarter. This credit
						  load enables a student to complete all graduation requirements
						  within
						  12 quarters.<br>						  
						  <span class="topicheading">Registration</span><br>
						  Students are expected to register during the designated
						  preregistration periods
						  for their next quarter on campus. Prior to registration,
						  students are required to
						  acquaint themselves with the class schedule, academic
						  policies, procedures, and
						  regulations in this catalogue and the student handbook
						  as well as consult with
						  their advisor and other faculty regarding course selection
						  options. Each student
						  must have his/her advisor&rsquo;s signature on the registration form
						  in order to
						  register for classes. The Registrar&rsquo;s Office may move students
						  from one section
						  of a course to another to both balance the sections
						  (requested by the department)
						  and to accommodate the schedules of all students registered
						  for a
						  particular course.<br>						  
						  <br>
						  Registration and validation are not complete until
						  fees are paid or
						  arrangements for payment have been made with the business
						  office. The
						  College reserves the right to withdraw a student for
						  failure to meet the designated
						  deadlines of registration and validation.<br>						  
						  <br>
						  Registration may be denied a student for failure to
						  adhere to health center
						  regulations, lack of tuition payment validation, or
						  disciplinary action.<br>						  
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Drop/Add</span><br>
						  Students may drop/add courses through the end of the
						  first week of a quarter.
						  All changes made to a student&rsquo;s class schedule must be on file
						  in the Registrar&rsquo;s
						  office by the end of the first week.<br>						  
						  <br>
						  Students are responsible for accurate registration
						  and are held accountable
						  for courses that appear on the final registration.
						  All academic courses, 200-level
						  partial credit classes, and PE activities must be added
						  or dropped within the
						  official time limit or they will be subject to failing
						  grades. Subsequent to the
						  drop/add period, students may exercise their option
						  to withdraw from a course
						  earning a W or WF (see Course Withdrawal section for
						  additional information).
						  Students will be held accountable for classes remaining
						  on their class
						  schedules at the end of a quarter and will be graded
						  accordingly. Students will
						  not receive a grade for courses not appearing on their
						  class schedule.<br>
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Underload</span><br>
						  Students may choose to underload (carry two units)
						  in a given quarter in consultation
						  with their advisor, the Office of Financial Aid, and
						  the Registrar.
						  Students who are underloading are not considered full-time
						  and are, therefore,
						  ineligible for Dean&rsquo;s List consideration and may be ineligible
						  for certain forms
						  of financial aid, insurance coverage, and participation
						  in intercollegiate
						  athletics. Students should also consider the ramifications
						  underloading may
						  have on timely completion of graduation requirements.<br>
						  <br>
					      <span class="topicheading">Overload</span><br>
					      An overload is defined as a total registration of
						    4 units in a single quarter, not
						  including courses numbered 200 or applied music courses.
						  Overload and transfer credit policies apply to first-time
						  and transfer
						  students entering Kalamazoo College with fewer than
						  18 transfer units. Once
						  students have begun their studies at Kalamazoo College,
						  they may attempt four
						  overloads, or complete four transfer units, or combine
						  overload and transfer
						  credits up to a maximum of four units. To overload,
						  students must meet the
						  following GPA minimums:

						   <p>Transfer students entering Kalamazoo College with the
						  maximum of 18<br>
						  units may overload up to four units, in accordance
						  with the GPA guidelines,<br>
						  but may not transfer in any additional course work.<br>					      
						  <br>						  
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Course Withdrawal</span><br>
						  Students may initiate a total of four course withdrawals
						  during the completion<br>
						  of their degree. A student may exercise more than one
						  course withdrawal per<br>
						  academic year; however, no student may withdraw from
						  more than one course<br>
						  during a given quarter. If a student feels withdrawal
						  from more than one course<br>
						  is necessary, or if a student is advised to withdraw
						  from more than one course<br>
						  due to a health or family emergency situation, the
						  student will be withdrawn<br>
						  from the quarter and from the College. Students will
						  be required to go through<br>
						  the formal readmission process to resume their study.
						  If a student is advised to<br>
						  withdraw from one or more courses for health reasons,
						  this withdrawal will not<br>
						  be counted against the four allowable.<br>						  
						  <br>
						  Students may withdraw from a course from the second
						  week through the<br>
						  eighth week of a quarter. After eighth week, students
						  may not withdraw from a<br>
						  course. (They may exercise the option to fully withdraw
						  from the College.)<br>
						  Course withdrawals exercised between second and eighth
						  week will receive a<br>
						  grade of W or WF. The grade will be issued by the instructor
						  based on the<br>
						  earned grade at the time of the withdrawal request.
						  Students will be required to<br>
						  obtain signatures from the instructor, their advisor,
						  and the Registrar. Students<br>
						  should be aware that course withdrawal may affect a
						  student&rsquo;s financial aid eligibility<br>
						  and grace period, medical insurance coverage, athletic
						  eligibility, study<br>
						  abroad eligibility, sequencing of classes, and timely
						  completion of<br>
						  degree requirements.<br>						  
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Course Attendance</span><br>
						  Attendance is the responsibility of the student and
						  is regulated within each<br>
						  course. Faculty members may report to the Early Alert
						  Committee those<br>
						  students whose absences may be impairing their performances.<br>
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">						  Final Examinations</span><br>
						  Examinations are held at the end of each quarter for
						  most courses. Students and<br>
						  faculty are required to follow the exam schedule as
						  set by the Registrar.<br>
						  However, if a student has three final exams scheduled
						  for the same calendar<br>
						  day, one of these exams may be changed by making arrangements
						  with<br>
						  the instructor.<br>						  
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Credit/No Credit Option for Seniors</span><br>
						  During the senior year, a student may elect to complete
						  one on-campus course<br>
						  as credit/no credit (CR/NC) if the following conditions
						  are met: 
						  <li> the course must be outside the major, minor, concentration, or
						  cognate 
						  of the major or minor; 
						  <li> the individual instructor must approve the CR/NC option; and 
						  <li> the appropriate forms must be on file in the Registrar&rsquo;s
						  office by Friday 
						  of first week. 
					    
						   <p> 
						  The CR/NC option is irrevocable after Friday of first
						  week, and is not<br>
						  subject to appeal by either the student or the instructor.<br>
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Audit</span><br>
						  Students may audit a course with permission of the
						  instructor. There is no<br>
						  official registration or notation on the transcript.
						  There is no audit fee for registered<br>
						  Kalamazoo College students. There is a minimal audit
						  fee for all non-<br>
						  Kalamazoo students.<br>
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Other Means of Earning Credit</span><br>
						  Advanced Placement (AP) Credit, 
						  International Baccalaureate (IB) Credit,<br>
						  Dual Enrollment Credit<br>
						  Please refer to the &ldquo;Admission&rdquo; section of the Academic Catalog.</p>
						   <p>						     <strong>Interinstitutional Enrollment</strong><br>
						     Students at Kalamazoo College may take advantage
						     of opportunities offered by<br>
						     the Kalamazoo Consortium for Higher Education by
						     enrolling in courses at<br>
						  Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo Valley Community
						  College, or<br>
						  Davenport University. Kalamazoo College students must
						  be registered for an<br>
						  on-campus quarter and must include this course as part
						  of a normal full-time<br>
						  registration. Admission to classes is offered on a &ldquo;space available&rdquo; basis.<br>
						  Specific registration information and forms are available
						  from the Registrar&rsquo;s<br>
						  office. Courses taken under the interinstitutional
						  program are included in<br>
						  Kalamazoo College tuition charges and will appear on
						  the Kalamazoo College<br>
						  transcript; the grade(s) received will be calculated
						  in the Kalamazoo College<br>
						  GPA. Interinstitutional courses are not considered
						  transfer course work and,<br>
						  therefore, do not apply toward the maximum allowable
						  transfer units.<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Michigan Guest Student Enrollment</strong><br>
						  Students wishing to take courses, during a period in
						  which they are not<br>
						  enrolled at Kalamazoo College, at another Michigan
						  college or university may<br>
						  do so through the Michigan Uniform Undergraduate Guest
						  Application<br>
						  process. A Kalamazoo College student must have preapproval
						  and must be in<br>
						  good standing to participate. The College reserves
						  the right to deny credits that<br>
						  are not preapproved. Further information is available
						  from the 
						  Registrar&rsquo;s office.<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>						  Independent Study</strong><br>
						  Generally, an independent study (398/498) is limited
						  to superior students<br>
						  taking advanced work in their major field of study.
						  This option is open to<br>
						  juniors and seniors only (overload criteria applies).
						  Students may not receive<br>
						  credit for more than one independent study course per
						  quarter or for more than<br>
						  two independent studies during degree completion.<br>
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Transfer Credits</span><br>
						  <strong>New Transfer Students</strong><br>
						  For students whose first full-time enrollment was not
						  at Kalamazoo College,<br>
						  determination of transfer credit will be made at the
						  time of enrollment. All<br>
						  credit is awarded by the Registrar in consultation
						  with the departmental faculty.<br>
						  Kalamazoo College accepts a maximum of 18 units in
						  transfer credit. Students<br>
						  transferring the maximum of 18 units at the time of
						  enrollment at Kalamazoo College<br>
						  may not transfer additional units. All transfer credits
						  must be earned from a<br>
						  regionally accredited institution with a grade of C
						  or above (C- is not acceptable).<br>
						  Transfer units to the College come in as credit only.
						  The GPA is not<br>
						  carried over from the transfer institution to Kalamazoo
						  College.<br>
						  <br>
						  Transfer students are responsible for meeting the residency
						  requirement: a<br>
						  minimum of six full-time quarters, the last three of
						  which must be in the senior<br>
						  year. Students transferring the maximum number of 18
						  units must earn a<br>
						  minimum of 18 academic units, in addition to the LACC
						  and PE activity units,<br>
						  at Kalamazoo College. If a student must register for
						  9 or fewer quarters to<br>
						  complete the degree, the LACC requirement will be prorated.<br>
						  <br>
						  Transfer units may be used to satisfy Area of Study,
						  language, and quantitative<br>
						  reasoning requirements and, at the discretion of the
						  departmental faculty,<br>
						  may be used toward majors, minors, and concentrations.
						  Transfer units may not<br>
						  be used to satisfy the cultures requirement.<br>
						  <br>
						  All work to be considered for transfer credit must
						  be submitted on an<br>
						  official transcript sent directly from the transfer
						  institution to Kalamazoo<br>
						  College within the first quarter of enrollment. The
						  College reserves the right to<br>
						  deny transfer credit not reported within the first
						  quarter of enrollment.<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Continuing Students</strong><br>
						  Students who first enrolled at Kalamazoo College are
						  limited to a maximum of<br>
						  four transfer and overload combined units during enrollment
						  and degree completion.<br>
						  (AP, IB, and dual enrollment credits brought into Kalamazoo
						  College at<br>
						  the time of enrollment are not included in this restriction.)
						  Transfer credits must<br>
						  be preapproved and earned from a regionally accredited
						  institution with a<br>
						  grade of C or better (C- is not acceptable). After
						  students have reached junior<br>
						  standing at Kalamazoo College, only junior- and senior-level
						  courses (usually<br>
						  numbered 300 and above) from four-year institutions
						  will be considered for<br>
						  transfer credit. The College reserves the right to
						  deny credit that has not been<br>
						  preapproved. A student may not repeat a course either
						  at Kalamazoo College or<br>
						  at another institution to replace a D or F once they
						  have taken a higher level<br>
						  course. No repeated course at an institution other
						  than Kalamazoo College will<br>
						  change the Kalamazoo College cumulative GPA. Transfer
						  credit does not fulfill<br>
						  cultures requirements.<br>
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Kalamazoo College Placement Examinations</span><br>
						  <strong>Foreign Language Placement</strong><br>
						  Students who have previously studied a foreign language
						  must take the<br>
						  Kalamazoo College placement test. Placement in foreign
						  language courses<br>
						  depends on the score earned on the Kalamazoo College
						  placement test or the College Board Advanced Placement
						  Examination or SAT II. Students who have<br>
						  completed three or more years of foreign language in
						  high school are ineligible<br>
						  to receive credit for the same language at the 101
						  level and must begin at the<br>
						  102, or higher, level of study. Academic credit is
						  not granted for foreign<br>
						  language placement.<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Mathematics Placement</strong><br>
						  Placement in mathematics courses depends on the score
						  earned on the<br>
						  Kalamazoo College placement test or the College Board
						  Advanced Placement<br>
						  Examination. Students planning to enter the fields
						  of science, math, and/or<br>
						  computer science should take a math placement examination
						  upon arrival at<br>
						  the College. This is critical for proper placement
						  in the math sequence.<br>
						  Academic credit is not granted for math placement.<br>
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Grading Practices</span><br>
						  <strong>Grades</strong><br>
						  The grade point system at Kalamazoo College is:<br>
						  A+, A, A- = 4 quality points (excellent)<br>
						  B+, B, B- = 3 quality points (above average)<br>
						  C+, C, C- = 2 quality points (average)<br>
						  D+, D, D- = 1 quality point (below average)<br>
						  F = 0 quality points (failure)<br>
						  <br>
						  CR (credit) and NC (no credit), H (honors), IP (in
						  progress), W<br>
						  (withdraw), and WF (withdraw failure) do not affect
						  the grade point average<br>
						  (GPA). IP is used to indicate the status of a course
						  that continues over more<br>
						  than one quarter. Pluses and minuses appear on transcripts
						  but are not used to<br>
						  calculate the Kalamazoo College GPA.<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Incomplete Grades</strong><br>
						  An I (incomplete) is recorded when work is of acceptable
						  quality but has not<br>
						  been finished because of illness or other extraordinary
						  circumstances. An I automatically<br>
						  becomes an F (or NC) if the work has not been completed
						  by the end<br>
						  of the sixth week of the next quarter, whether the
						  student is on or off campus,<br>
						  has left the College, or has graduated.<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Repeated Courses</strong><br>
						  A grade of D, F, W, WF, or NC may be repeated if the
						  repeated enrollment is at<br>
						  Kalamazoo College. Both attempts will appear on students&rsquo; transcripts,
						  but<br>
						  only the second attempt will be used to calculate the
						  Kalamazoo College cumulative<br>
						  GPA. Students who hope to earn a degree may not accumulate
						  more than<br>
						  a total of 7 unsuccessfully attempted units. Unsuccessful
						  attempts include all<br>
						  F&rsquo;s, NC&rsquo;s and W&rsquo;s, excluding any W&rsquo;s which have
						  been explicitly mitigated by<br>
						  the committee on Satisfactory Academic Progress. Students
						  may accumulate a<br>
						  maximum of 4 W&rsquo;s within the total of 7 unsuccessfully attempted
						  units.<br>
						  Students may not repeat a course either at Kalamazoo
						  College or at another<br>
						  institution to replace a D or F once they have taken
						  a higher level course. Any<br>
						  course repeated at another institution does not affect
						  the original course grade<br>
						  on the Kalamazoo College transcript or figure into
						  the calculation of the<br>
						  Kalamazoo College cumulative GPA. Repeating courses
						  may also result in the<br>
						  inability to complete the graduation requirements in
						  4 years.<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Change of Grade</strong><br>
						  Students seeking a grade change should first contact
						  the course instructor who<br>
						  is responsible for the grade issued. Both students
						  and faculty should understand<br>
						  that a change in an assigned grade should reflect only
						  identifiable and distinct<br>
						  errors in the evaluation process. Students should initiate
						  this process as soon as<br>
						  possible and no later than the end of the sixth week
						  of the next quarter or<br>
						  within six weeks from graduation or withdrawal from
						  the College. Students&rsquo;<br>
						  grade changes, which may merit award of Dean&rsquo;s List or commendation,
						  will<br>
						  be reviewed upon receipt of the grade change(s). Further
						  details are available<br>
						  from the Registrar.<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) Courses and Programs</strong><br>
						  The SIP, GLCA programs, LAC, physical education, 200-level/partial
						  credit<br>
						  courses (excluding music), and the senior CR/NC option
						  receive a grade of CR<br>
						  or NC and do not affect the cumulative GPA. CR/NC options
						  are not available<br>
						  in the major, minor, concentration, or cognate courses.<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Partial Credit Courses</strong><br>
						  Partial credit (200-level) courses are offered for
						  1/3, 1/4, and 1/5 of a unit each<br>
						  registration. A student must complete the requisite
						  number of partial credits (all<br>
						  in the same course) to receive one unit. The full unit
						  for a 200-level course may<br>
						  be used once as part of a quarter load of three units
						  during the quarter in which<br>
						  the credit is being completed. Students may count one
						  200-level course outside<br>
						  the major toward the 38 units required for graduation.
						  A 200-level unit does not<br>
						  count as an official overload. The following partial
						  credit courses are offered:<br>
						  BIOL 200 (CR/NC) 1/3 credit x 3 quarters = 1 unit<br>
						  JAPN 200 (graded) 1/2 credit x 2 quarters = 1 unit<br>
						  MUSC 200 (graded) 1/5 credit x 5 quarters = 1 unit*<br>
						  Applied Music (graded) 1/5 credit x 5 quarters = 1
						  unit<br>
						  THEA 200 (CR/NC) 1/4 credit x 4 quarters = 1 unit*<br>
						  * required for the major<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Music Ensembles</strong><br>
						  One unit of credit is awarded after five quarters of
						  participation in an ensemble.<br>
						  Only two ensemble activities per quarter may be credited
						  toward the five<br>
						  required for the unit of credit. A music ensemble credit
						  may be used to satisfy<br>
						  the creative expression requirement. Nonmusic majors
						  may count only one unit<br>
						  of ensemble credit toward the 38 units required for
						  graduation. Music majors<br>
						  may count two 200-level units toward graduation. The
						  unit may be counted<br>
						  only once in a quarter load of three units and will
						  occur in the quarter in which<br>
						  the credit is being completed.<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Grade Reports</strong><br>
						  Grade reports are issued to students at the end of
						  each quarter. The report is<br>
						  sent either to the student&rsquo;s home address, to another address the
						  student has 
						  given to the Registrar&rsquo;s office, or to the student&rsquo;s campus
						  mailbox. Copies of<br>
						  grade reports will be sent to parents only if students
						  present a signed statement<br>
						  of request to the Registrar.<br>
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Records</span><br>
						  <strong>Student Information and Records</strong><br>
						  The official educational record of students is the
						  file maintained in the<br>
						  Registrar&rsquo;s office. This file contains all official enrollment
						  and academic information.<br>
						  It is the responsibility of students to have all pertinent
						  information<br>
						  regarding declarations, changes, waivers, exemptions,
						  scores, and transcripts on<br>
						  file in the Registrar&rsquo;s Office.<br>
						  <br>
						  The College subscribes fully to the guidelines set
						  forth in the Family<br>
						  Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974
						  , Section 438 of the<br>
						  General Education Provision Act. It provides students
						  who have matriculated<br>
						  access to records directly related to them and protects
						  the information<br>
						  contained within those files from unauthorized persons.<br>
						  <br>
						  Information about students contained in educational
						  records must be<br>
						  made accessible to them, to persons authorized by students,
						  and to Kalamazoo<br>
						  College faculty and staff who have legitimate educational
						  interests. Information<br>
						  must also be furnished to comply with a judicial order
						  or subpoena.<br>
						  The College shall disclose to the victim of an alleged
						  crime of violence the<br>
						  penalty imposed in a judicial hearing concerning that
						  allegation.<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Releasing Confidential Information</strong><br>
						  Releasing confidential information (includes units
						  attempted, units earned,<br>
						  grades, GPA, address, phone number, and class schedule)
						  to anyone other than<br>
						  students or College personnel with a legitimate need
						  to know will require<br>
						  written authorization from the students.<br>
						  1. Students must sign a request to be kept on file
						  in the office to which<br>
						  the request has been made.<br>
						  2. Each release will require a new written authorization.<br>
						  3. The College reserves the right to withhold a request
						  if there is an outstanding<br>
						  financial debt to the College or an unresolved<br>
						  disciplinary action.<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Transcripts</strong><br>
						  Transcripts must be requested in writing by students.
						  An official transcript<br>
						  bearing the seal of Kalamazoo College can be mailed
						  to other educational institutions,<br>
						  certifying agencies, or employers; an unofficial transcript
						  without the<br>
						  seal may be issued directly to the student and will
						  be stamped &ldquo;Issued to<br>
						  Student.&rdquo; The charge for each official transcript is $3.00. Currently
						  enrolled<br>
						  students may obtain an unofficial transcript free-of-charge
						  at any time.<br>
						  Nonenrolled students will be charged $1.00 for each
						  unofficial transcript. The<br>
						  College will not release an official transcript unless
						  it has been paid for and satisfactory<br>
						  arrangements have been made with the business office
						  for payment of<br>
						  any outstanding College bills or fines. The College
						  will not send a transcript by<br>
						  fax. Transcripts can be processed by overnight express
						  mail at the students&rsquo;<br>
						  expense. The Registrar&rsquo;s office requires a minimum of two to three
						  business<br>
						  days to process a transcript request.<br><br>
						  <strong>Directory Information</strong>
						  <br>
						  Directory information may be provided to anyone who
						  inquires without the<br>
						  prior consent of students unless they have submitted
						  a written request to<br>
						  withhold such information. Directory information includes
						  the following:<br>
&bull; campus phone number from the directory<br>
&bull; dates of attendance<br>
&bull; campus box number from the directory<br>
&bull; degree(s) awarded<br>
&bull; classification of any student<br>
&bull; leadership positions within the College<br>
&bull; date (but not year) of birth<br>
&bull; place of birth<br>
&bull; sports statistics<br>
&bull; major field of study<br>
&bull; awards received<br>
<em>NOTE: Address/telephone information (such as the faculty,
						  staff, and student directory)<br>
			    is not provided by the College to external agencies
			    or individuals. This information is<br>
			    intended only for use by members of the immediate College
			    community.</em><br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Withholding Directory Information</strong><br>
						  1. Students must file a written request to withhold
						  directory information<br>
						  with the Dean of Students.<br>
						  2. The phone number and address will be removed from
						  the quarter<br>
						  phone list and the student/faculty directory, if they
						  have not yet<br>
						  been printed.<br>
						  3. The Dean of Students will provide written notification
						  of this request<br>
						  to all appropriate parties within the institution.<br>
						  Students should realize that withholding this information
						  may complicate<br>
						  enrollment verification to future employers or graduate
						  schools and dissemination<br>
						  of information from within the College.<br>
						  <br>
						  <span class="topicheading">Academic Progress</span><br>
						  <strong>Classification</strong><br>
						  Classification is determined by the number of academic
						  units (LACC and PE<br>
						  not included) accumulated. The class in which students
						  are listed is generally<br>
						  determined as follows
						  <li>First-Year 0&ndash;7 units*
						 <li>Sophomore 8&ndash;16 units
						 <li>Junior 17&ndash;25 units
				 		<li>Senior 26 units and above<br>
				 		  <br>
  * First-year students who bring in AP, IB, or dual
						    enrollment credits are<br>
					      reclassified, as appropriate, at the end of the first
						    year.<br>
					      Students are classified once a year at the completion
						    of the Spring quarter.<br>
					      However, transfer students may be reclassified at
						    any time based on the<br>
					      units earned.<br>
					      <br>
					      Classification is regulated not only by the number
						    of units earned, but<br>
					      also by the expected year of graduation. Changes
						    may be made only by the<br>
					      Registrar in consultation with the Committee on Academic
						    Standards.<br>
						    <br>
					        <strong>Good Standing</strong><br>
					      Students who maintain two-thirds of all grades at
						    the level of C- or better are<br>
					      considered to be in good standing at Kalamazoo College.<br>
					      <br>
					      Students should be aware that maintaining good academic
						    standing does<br>
					      not ensure continued financial aid eligibility. Grades
						    of NC, W, or WF may also<br>
					      affect an award. Please refer to the &ldquo;Financial Assistance&rdquo; section
						    of this<br>
					      catalogue for further information.<br>
					      <br>
					      <strong>Graduation Standard</strong><br>
					      All students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.00
						    to be eligible to receive a<br>
					      Kalamazoo College degree.<br>
					      <br>
					      <strong>Early Alert</strong><br>
					      Kalamazoo College maintains a system of &ldquo;Early Alert&rdquo; for
						    students who we<br>
					      feel may be placing themselves in academic jeopardy.
						    This process has been<br>
					      developed within the parameters of confidentiality
						    and personal integrity of<br>
					      each student and College personnel involved. Each
						    quarter instructors and<br>
					      advisors are asked to inform the Registrar of students
						    who may be causing<br>
					      concern exhibited by, but not limited to, one of
						    the following: poor attendance,<br>
					      missed assignments or tests, lack of participation
						    in class, failing tests, showing<br>
					      signs of emotional or physical distress, or previous
						    placement on academic<br>
					      probation. These &ldquo;alerts&rdquo; are, in turn, reviewed weekly
						    by a small group of<br>
					      student development and academic administrators.
						    This group works closely<br>
					      with the academic advisor, instructor and, where
						    necessary, the student to help<br>
					      move that student in a positive direction. They also
						    make referrals as warranted<br>
					      and generally encourage the student to begin developing
						    strategies that will<br>
					      promote a positive academic experience.<br>
					      <br>
					      <strong>Academic Warning</strong><br>
					      The Committee on Academic Standards meets at the
						    end of each quarter to<br>
					      review the grades of all students. If it appears
						    that a student is having a<br>
					      difficult time as indicated by more than one withdrawn
						    course over a twoquarter<br>
					      period or falling grades as compared to previous
						    work, a &ldquo;warning&rdquo;<br>
					      letter is issued by the Registrar. This warning is
						    a mechanism used to let<br>
					      students know that they should seek out their advisors
						    to develop strategies for<br>
					      improvement. If students fail to act upon this warning
						    they may find themselves<br>
					      placed on academic probation.<br>
					      <br>
					      <strong>Academic Probation</strong><br>
					      The Committee on Academic Standards will place students
						    on academic<br>
					      probation whenever they have accumulated more than
						    one-third of their total<br>
					      units below a C-, or the cumulative GPA falls below
						    2.00. Students may also be<br>
					      placed on academic probation if they are not making
						    satisfactory academic<br>
					      progress toward the degree. Placing a student on
						    academic probation is an indication<br>
					      that immediate action needs to be taken on the part
						    of the student to<br>
					      improve academic performance. Students on academic
						    probation are advised to<br>
					      meet with their academic advisor within the first
						    two weeks of the subsequent<br>
					      quarter and perhaps weekly thereafter in order to
						    develop strategies for<br>
					      success. It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to seek this assistance
						    and ensure<br>
					      progress toward degree completion. In addition to
						    meeting with their advisors,<br>
					      students are encouraged to seek assistance through
						    our support services in the<br>
					      Academic Resource Center; subject tutoring through
						    supplemental instruction<br>
					      and individual departments; career counseling and
						    testing through the Career<br>
					      Development Center; and personal counseling through
						    the Office of Student<br>
					      Development. Failure to meet these responsibilities
						    may result in continued or<br>
					      final probation or dismissal from the College.<br>
					      <br>
					      <strong>Continued Academic Probation</strong><br>
					      Placing students on &ldquo;continued academic probation&rdquo; indicates
						    that adequate<br>
					      progress toward a degree continues to be in jeopardy.
						    Unless improvement is<br>
					      made, students may be placed on final probation and
						    subsequently may be<br>
					      subject to dismissal from the College. Students placed
						    on continued academic<br>
					      probation are advised to meet with their advisors
						    during the subsequent<br>
					      quarter. Failure to be removed from probation may
						    result in final probation or<br>
					      dismissal from Kalamazoo College.<br>
					      <br>
					      <strong>Final Academic Probation&mdash;C Average</strong><br>
					      Students placed on &ldquo;final academic probation&mdash;C average&rdquo; must
						    be enrolled in<br>
					      and complete three letter-graded courses in the next
						    quarter of residence and<br>
					      earn a minimum GPA of 2.0 for the quarter. Failure
						    to meet this requirement<br>
					      will result in dismissal from the College.<br>
					      <br>
					      <strong>Final Academic Probation&mdash;Three Cs</strong><br>
					      Students placed on &ldquo;final academic probation&mdash;three Cs&rdquo; must
						    be enrolled in<br>
					      and complete three letter-graded courses in the next
						    quarter of residence and<br>
					      earn a minimum grade of C- in each of the three courses
						    for the quarter. Failure<br>
					      to meet this requirement will result in dismissal
						    from Kalamazoo College.<br>
						    <br>
					        <strong>Veteran&rsquo;s Administration</strong><br>
					      The Veteran&rsquo;s Administration (VA) requires that all recipients
						    of veteran educational<br>
					      benefits maintain a cumulative grade point average
						    of 2.0 to remain<br>
					      eligible. A veteran who allows the cumulative GPA
						    to fall below 2.0 will be<br>
					      placed on probation. A veteran will be allowed two
						    quarters to bring the cumulative<br>
					      GPA to the level of 2.0. If the veteran fails to
						    do so, the VA will be notified<br>
					      of unsatisfactory progress and enrollment will not
						    be certified to the VA.<br>
					      Certification may resume once the cumulative GPA
						    has reached 2.0. The<br>
					      Veteran&rsquo;s Administration may rescind benefits if a veteran does
						    not present a<br>
					      GPA of 2.0 at the time of graduation.<br>
					      <br>
					      <br>
					      <strong>Withdrawal from the College</strong><br>
					      If a student chooses to withdraw from the College,
						    we recommend the student<br>
					      start the withdrawal process with either the Registrar
						    or Dean of Students. In<br>
					      either case, the student will be asked to complete
						    a withdrawal application to<br>
					      collect pertinent information. The student will also
						    receive useful information<br>
					      about separating from the College and will be advised
						    to meet with a staff<br>
					      person from the Financial Aid Office if he/she received
						    federal financial aid<br>
					      while enrolled at the College. See the College&rsquo;s refund policy
						    in the &ldquo;Expenses&rdquo;<br>
					      section of this catalog for complete details on refunds
						    and return of financial<br>
					      aid funds. A grade of W will be issued for all registered
						    course work.<br>
					      If a student fails to return to campus for a planned
						    on-campus quarter, the<br>
					      College reserves the right to withdraw the student.
						    Students who elect to take<br>
					      one or more quarters off (with the exception of approved
						    career development,<br>
					      study abroad, or GLCA programs) will be withdrawn
						    from the College.<br>
						    <br>
					        <strong>Readmission</strong><br>
					      If a student withdraws or is withdrawn from the College,
						    application for readmission<br>
					      will be required. Students must file an application
						    with the Registrar.<br>
					      If a student withdrew from the College while on academic
						    probation or<br>
					      was dismissed or withdrawn for academic reasons,
						    the application will be<br>
					      forwarded to the Committee on Academic Standards
						    for review. Students must<br>
					      indicate in writing how the problem that led to probation,
						    withdrawal, or<br>
					      dismissal has been resolved or addressed. If the
						    withdrawal or dismissal was<br>
					      for academic reasons, students must provide evidence
						    of successful completion<br>
					      of academic work at another institution. For students
						    withdrawn for disciplinary,<br>
					      financial, or health-related reasons, readmissions
						    must be initiated in the<br>
					      Dean of Students Office.<br>
					      <br>
					      Students applying for readmission are encouraged
						    to do so before their<br>
					      anticipated quarter of return in order to allow time
						    for any registration,<br>
					      housing, or financial aid processes. Students who
						    interrupt their course of<br>
					      study for more than two quarters will be required
						    to follow the degree requirements<br>
					      as stated in the Academic Catalogue at the time of
						    readmission.<br>
						    <br>
					        <span class="topicheading">Honors</span><br>
					        <strong>Dean&rsquo;s List</strong><br>
					      Students who earn a GPA of 3.5 or better for a full-time
						    credit load of three<br>
					      letter-graded units within a given quarter will be
						    placed on the Dean&rsquo;s List.<br>
					      Students will not be considered for the Dean&rsquo;s List during a
						    quarter in which an<br>
					      I, W, or CR/NC is received. Dean&rsquo;s list honors are not recorded
						    on the<br>
					      academic transcript.<br>
					      <br>
					      <strong>Commendation</strong><br>
					      Students who earn a GPA of 4.0 for a full-time credit
						    load of three letter-graded<br>
					      units within a given quarter will be sent a letter
						    of commendation from the<br>
					      faculty. Students will not be considered for commendation
						    during a quarter in<br>
					      which an I, W, or CR/NC is received. Faculty commendation
						    honors are not<br>
				        recorded on the academic transcript.<br>
				 		  <br>
				 		  <strong>Honors and High Honors</strong><br>
				 		  Honors and high honors are awarded each year for
						    the previous year&rsquo;s achievements.<br>
					      To be eligible for honors/high honors, students must
						    have completed at<br>
					      least one full term (three letter-graded units on
						    campus) during an academic<br>
					      year and may not have failed, withdrawn from, or
						    had an IP (in progress) grade<br>
					      in any course during that year, either on or off
						    campus. Honors = 3.50 to 3.74<br>
					      GPA; high honors = 3.75 and above. This recognition
						    is posted on students&rsquo;<br>
					      transcripts for each year of eligibility, and students
						    are recognized at the fall<br>
					      Honors Day Convocation.<br>
					      <br>
					      <strong>Graduation Honors (Latin Honors)</strong><br>
					      The Bachelor of Arts degree is awarded cum laude
						    if students maintain a cumulative<br>
					      grade point average of 3.50 to 3.74; magna cum laude
						    with an average of<br>
					      3.75 to 3.99; and summa cum laude with an average
						    of 4.0. Transfer students<br>
					      must earn a minimum of 15 letter-graded academic
						    units at Kalamazoo College<br>
					      to be considered for academic honors at the time
						    of graduation. This honor is<br>
					      announced at Commencement and recorded on the academic
						    transcript.<br>
						    <br>
					        <strong>Honors in the Majo</strong>r<br>
					      Honors in the major may be awarded at the discretion
						    of departmental faculty<br>
					      at the time of graduation. Usually, departments consider
						    the grade point<br>
					      average in the major, the results of the comprehensive
						    examination, and the<br>
					      senior individualized project in recommending students
						    for honors.<br>
					      Departments may set additional requirements. This
						    honor is announced at<br>
					      Commencement and recorded on the academic transcript.<br>

					        <strong>Commencement</strong><br>
					      Commencement ceremonies are held each year in June.
						    Members of the senior<br>
					      class are expected to attend both Baccalaureate and
