<HTML>    JAKARTA Indonesia AP  Sporadic rioting rising crime and continued student protests have worsened a retail slump in Indonesia according to the Indonesian Retailers' Association.    The increasingly uncertain situation on Jakarta's streets has resulted in many people leaving work earlier and reduced the likelihood of night shopping once a favorite pastime among affluent Jakarta residents.    ``I think some of the retailers also feel very much that their volumes will go down'' association chairman Steve Sondakh told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview released Tuesday.    ``They are naturally going to shorten their operating hours'' said Sondahk who is also a direct of the Hero supermarket chain one of Indonesia's biggest retail groups.    Consumer activity has already been hit by a deep recession caused by Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years.    Sondakh said retail sales on average have already fallen between 30 percent and 40 percent from a year ago with the electronics sector being the hardest hit. Sales there are down an estimated 60 percent.    The rise in lawlessness which has grown out of the unrest on the streets is also adding to retailers' woes. Crime has steadily increased in Jakarta with several foreign embassies advising their citizens to avoid the city of 11 million altogether.
